<h1>Information Technology Projects</h1>
<h2>1. House Numbering System for Bangalore City </h2>
<p> Numbering of houses in the Bangalore city as carried out by the City Corporation in the 70's was found to suffer from a lot of deficiencies since it did not follow a common logic. Therefore it caused difficulty to the citizens of Bangalore, visitors to Bangalore and even utility service departments like the Water supply, Post &amp; Telegraph in locating particular addresses. </p>
<p> A new system was designed after studying various numbering systems followed in many cities. As on off shoot to the work, preparation of maps of Bangalore city was undertaken. A detailed layout map as well as smaller maps of 1:10,000 scale were prepared and printed. These tasks were completed in 1979. </p>
<p> The numbering system divided the city into zones, each following a local coordinate system, broadly identifying the east-west and north-south roads. Each house was identified by a multi-digit number. The first two digits indicated the intersecting cross roads and the other digits referred to the physical location of the address. Buildings on one side of the road were numbered odd and even numbers were given to buildings on the opposite side. </p>
<p> Though finalized about 8 years ago, this system has not yet been implemented fully in the city of Bangalore. Meanwhile, the city had grown many times beyond its size after 1970s. With the increasing pressures of growth, the city planners may once again consider rationalizing the system of house numbering more seriously. </p>
<p> Based on aerial photographs, street maps have been prepared. The City Corporation and Bangalore Development Authority were involved in confirming the accuracy of the maps. The streets and localities were then indexed. This information was brought out in the form of a street atlas and index titled Bangalore A-Z. </p>

<h2>2. Popularization of Science </h2>
<p> In order to popularize the achievements and methods of science, and thereby inculcate a scientific attitude in Karnataka, particularly among students and the rural populations, KSCST identified a project on 'Popularisation of Science' in 1977. </p>
<p> The objectives of the project were two-fold :
</p>


<table>
<tr>
<td> 1. </td>
<td> To produce a science magazine in Kannada catering to the age group of 10-15 years. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 2. </td>
<td> To co-ordinate the activities of the various voluntary agencies/organisations presently engaged in popularisation of science, with special emphasis on programmes geared to reach rural masses. </td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3> Progress :
</h3>
<p> In pursuit of its objectives, the Working Group brought out in June 1978 a monthly science magazine in Kannada with high-school students as the target group. This magazine 'BALAVIJNANA' was distributed free to all the high-schools and village panchayats in the State for a specific period. Through the production of the magazine, KSCST has been successful in securing the willing and enthusiastic participation of individuals and organisations hailing from different regions of Karnataka. The magazine is being published with an editorial board of four members, having Prof. J. R. Lashmana Rao as Chief Editor. </p>
<p> After the successful fulfillment of one of the objectives of the project, namely, to produce a science magazine for high school children, the Working Group took up in 1980 the task of coordinating the activities of several organisations in the state actively involved in science popularisation. Towards this end, the Working Group suggested guidelines for the formation of Karnataka Rajya Vijnana Parishat with the objective among others of continuing the activities of the KSCST project on popularisation of science. </p>

<h2>3. Computers in Administration: A Demonstration Project in the District of Gulbarga </h2>
<p> KSCST had identified public administration as one of the important areas for introduction of computers as a means of improving the efficiency of administration and increasing data file handling. Accordingly, a project titled ' Computers in Administration' was initiated in 1980 with the primary objectives of :
</p>


<table>
<tr>
<td> 1. </td>
<td> Detailed analysis of the flow of information in the critical areas and identifying steps involved in the decision making process; </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 2. </td>
<td> Identifying the appropriate areas where computers could be used as an aid to the decision making process; </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> 3. </td>
<td> Demonstration of the use of computers in these areas by actually installing and developing software for the purpose. </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> A preliminary study indicated that while enormous amount of data was available for processing the then existing decision making process did not make use of all the data. Microcomputers were making a headway, during that time, in the front end of information technology in Indian industries. Smaller machines with extremely large memory capacity and fast processing capabilities were becoming a reality. It was felt that this was the right time to evolve a strategy for the introduction of computers in Indian administration so that there would be a gradual and smooth transition from manual processing to EDP. Therefore the council initiated this project in collaboration with the office of Deputy Commissioner of Gulbarga district. </p>


<h2>4. A Study of Bangalore as an Urban Ecosystem </h2>
<p> The Urban Ecosystem approach involves a study of cities &quot;as the loci of living population interacting with natural and built environment. These interactions take place within a boundary permeable to inputs and outputs. Transactions in the city require energy and other resources with different amounts of knowledge and organisation to maintain life. The resources, particularly energy are supplied in the form of food and fuel, and indirectly in the form of material inputs&quot;. </p>
<p> Such an urban ecosystem approach permits the identification of resource-conserving programmes which in turn can have a profound effect on the planning of cities when these programmes are coupled with appropriate policy and institutional measures. </p>
