<h2> Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya Geospatial Chair</h2>

<h3> Introduction:</h3>
<p> In the era of information technology with rapid advancement in computing, decision making has become more easier and scientific and in this field, Geospatial Technology has emerged strongly with diverse applications. It has been identified as one of the three most important emerging fields along with nanotechnology and biotechnology because of providing unbiased, reliable, repetitive and synoptic nature of data as well as tools for integration of information for analysis, which is very useful in the management and monitoring of natural resources. There is requirement of trained and skilled personnel for the maximum potential exploration of this technology and also need to introduce it in education system for its wider understanding. There is also a need of well thought of plans for broader acceptability and awareness regarding geospatial technology for development of human resource through training and education. Geospatial Technology (GST) encompasses Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Remote Sensing (RS), and emerging technologies that assist the user in the collection, analysis and interpretation of spatial data.</p>
<p> Realising the importance of Geospatial Technology and with a view to popularize it, the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, New Delhi, in honour of and also as the year 2010 happened to be the 150th year of birth of Sir M.Visvesvaraya has instituted Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya Geospatial Chair at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. The Chair is associated with the Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. The Chair functions in collaboration with Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology (KSCST), IISc, Bangalore. The Chair came into existence with Dr.A.Perumal accepting the Chair Professorship and reporting for duty on 29th October 2012.</p>

<h3> Objectives of the Chair:</h3>
<p> As per the mandate of the Chair prescribed by the Department of Science and Technology, the Chair Professor has -</p>
<ul>
	<li> To carry out the job of popularizing the Geo-spatial Technology, for the benefit of the Students / Researchers, NGOs, Academicians, Planners, decision makers, State / Central Government department officials, Panchayath Raj Institutions / Urban Local Bodies, etc., </li>
	<li> To organise training workshops, seminars in frontier research areas related to Geospatial Sciences, capacity building and training programs for High School and College students and Teachers, officials from line departments of the State, NGOs and other user departments who primarily use Remote Sensing, GIS and GPS for the various developmental and implementation programmes in the State ;</li>
	<li> To promote research on modern methods of surveying and mapping as well as spatial data organization security, transaction and other related issues;</li>
	<li> To foster the concept and application of geospatial technologies in natural resources and infrastructure management.</li>
	<li> To organize multidisciplinary, multi institutional research programmes to develop a vibrant geospatial data infrastructure that can support decision making for creation and management of other infrastructures.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Beneficiaries / Target users of the outputs of the Chair :</h3>
<ul>
	<li> Students/Researchers</li>
	<li> NGOs, Academicians, Planners and decision makers</li>
	<li> State / Central Government departments</li>
	<li> Panchayath Raj Institutions/Urban Local bodies</li>
</ul>

<h3> Activities of the Chair :</h3>
<ul>
	<li> Organising two days training workshop to popularize Geospatial Technology for High School / Pre University Students and Teachers ;</li>
	<li> Organising Training Programme on Geo-spatial Technology for the officers of KSCST who are involved in NRDMS work in different districts of Karnataka ;</li>
	<li> Organising divisional level Training Workshop for District Officials in four divisions namely Belgaum, Mysore, Gulbarga and Bangalore, wherein each division covered seven to eight districts. The workshop covers various aspects of Remote Sensing applications, GIS and GPS which can be used for the various Water Shed and other development programs in the grass root level ;</li>
	<li> Organizing three days Workshop on Geospatial Technology and its applications for Engineering College Faculty wherein morning sessions includes lectures on the topics such as Introduction to GIS and Remote Sensing, Map making, Projection systems and Datums, Earth Observations Systems and different Satellites, various Satellite Products, Introduction to Photogrammetry, Digital Image Processing, Mobile GIS concepts and applications, Applications of GIS for Natural Resource Management, Introduction to GPS and Total Station, Microwave Remote Sensing and its applications and Snow and Glacial Hydrology, and the afternoon sessions are devoted for practicals and hands on experience. 
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Research Projects :</h3>
<ul>
	<li> A Study is being carried out for Kudapura Campus of IISc, Challakere Taluk, Chitradurga district to understand the Morphology, sub surface Lithology, Land use, Land cover and the Ground Water prospects of the terrain using remote sensing and GIS ;</li>
	<li> A Research Project has been taken up to study Hesaraghatta Lake and its catchment area using Remote Sensing and GIS Technology to understand the reasons for drying up of large water body using time series analysis of Remote Sensing data ;</li>
	<li> A Project on Solid Waste Management Study in and around Yeshwanthpur and Malleswaram area using Remote Sensing and GIS has also been taken up.</li>
	<li> In future, other Research Projects which are socially relevant on Natural Resources Management using Geospatial Technology can be taken up under this Chair.</li>
