<h1>Rural Industry Projects</h1><h2>1. Groundnut Oil Extraction</h2><p> Most of the fat requirement of an ordinary Indian is met by edible oils, of which groundnut oil is one of the most popular items. Groundnut, production in India is mainly concentrated in the states of Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharastra and Karnataka, which together account for more than 80% of the nation's output of groundnut. Of this, Karnataka's share is roughly 10%. Three technologies are currently used for primary extraction of groundnut oil an d these are : the traditional bullock-drawn ghani, the modified electrically energised : &quot; power ghani&quot; popularised by KVIC and the larger capacity oil expellers in the organised sector. In recent years, traditional ghanies have been progressively displaced and presently, the bulk of groundnut oil production is in the organised sector. Due to the importance of groundnut oil in the diet of a common person, and in the context of the existing market mechanism in the country, the market for groundnuts and groundnut oil is extremely erratic and very large price and supply variations are not unusual. In the context of wide-spread speculative practices in the trade, it is rather difficult to estimate the true cost components of groundnut oil production. Even marginal shortages have destabilized the market in the past. In view of these considerations, it is very important that the State initiate steps to assure stable prices and supply of this very essential commodity. </p><h2>2. Winnover</h2><p> Winnowing is the process of separating grain from chaff. For this purpose, the customary practice is to make use of natural air currents, thus leaving the farmer at the mercy of nature's vagaries. Foodgrains such as ragi, jowar, etc, are harvested in the months of September, October, March and April. Weather conditions during these months are such that processing of foodgrains is rendered quite a difficult task, involving a loss in the quality and quantity of products, both grain and husk. A study of the existing designs and equipment was made. This showed the availability of various units which are mostly inadequate and inappropriate for the winnowing needs of the average farmer, e.g., (a) combines/grain cleaners which are power operated and prohibitively expensive; (b) small imported winnowers, meant only for paddy, which involve high operating costs. </p><p>This study as also a preliminary survey conducted in some of the areas in Karnataka State showed that :</p><ol>	<li> available units are capital intensive and sophisticated, the result being that their market is limited. </li>	<li> they are useful only for certain types of grain like paddy, jowar, while they cannot be used for other grains like ragi, coriander etc. </li></ol><p> This information was used to lay down broad specifications regarding cost-effectiveness, versatility and simplicity in the design of the winnower. A somewhat sophisticated test unit was designed and fabricated so as to collect information on various parameters such as rate of air supply, rate of feed of stock, etc. The unit is amenable to both manual and power operation. It was tested with samples in the laboratory and a number of experiments varying different parameters were conducted. A continued extensive field test in a few villages was also carried out.</p><h2>3. Utilization of Plant Waste for Maintenance of Paper on a Village Scale</h2><p> In most of the agro based rural industries if the organic wastes of the processes, like sugarcane bagasse in a jaggery unit or sisal bagasse in a sisal based unit are utlised for producing useful products, the units become more commercially viable. Use of bagasse as domestic fuel is not popular on account of excessive ash being produced off the burning process. In spite of a favourable consideration of these bagasse for use in a biogas plant, not many large scale plants are in operation. The practice on a wide scale in Mexico. But the last option of producing paper from these wastes seems to be the most promising of all these alternatives. However, initial studies identified technical problems which had to be solved before such operation would be taken up as viable ventures in rural areas. </p><h2>4. Sisal Industries Demonstration Unit</h2><p> Rural economies can be improved by introducing activities which generate local employment. While endeavouring to identify such activities, the State council recognized sisal (Agave veracruz) as a potential raw material for small scale agro industries in semi arid areas. This project established the feasibility of sisal based agro industry and initiated the process of developing various technologies required for complete uitlization of sisal leaves harvested in semi aid areas.</p><p> In subsequent projects, technology and equipment for small scale industry were developed for :</p><ol>	<li> Making ropes out of the fibre extracted from sisal leaves. </li>	<li> Extraction of hecogenin, a compound used in the manufacture of steriodal drugs </li>	<li> Manufacture of hand made paper </li></ol>	<p> Based on this, the following projects were funded: </p><ol>	<li> Sisal industries demonstration unit to be set up at Ungra with the objective of manufacturing fibre, hecogenin and paper from sisal leaves at ascaled up version of one tonne of sisal leaves per day capacity. </li>	<li> A project to develop the process for the manufacture of pregnon and andrastanolone from hecogenin at the laboratory scale. </li></ol>
