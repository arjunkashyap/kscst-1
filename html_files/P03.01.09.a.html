<h1>Water Projects</h1><h2>1. Case Study of Dodda Gubbi Village Lake </h2><p> Wetlands have an important role in the ecological balance of a state Karnataka has had a long history of utilization of wetlands, with some of the districts of the state having the highest concentration of tanks in the country. It is known that, until fairly recent times, a well- defined, functional, village-level system for maintenance of these tanks existed. However, of late, the wetlands have fallen into considerable neglect causing serious damage to the ecological balance.</p><p> Taking note of the need to investigate the damage suffered by wetlands, KSCST initiated a case stayed of Dodda Gubbi lake located in Gub bi Village, Hoskote taluk. The objective of the study was to estimate the amount of water impounded in earlier years in comparison to the prevailing condition of the lake; to analyse the prevailing land-use in the catchment area; and to indicate action necessary for preventing further damage to the lake. These studies would be useful for evolving a methodology for the study of wetlands. Mr. Zafar Futehally, Vice-President, World Wildlife Fund was nominated as Convener of the study group. </p><h2>2. Hand Pumps for Drinking Water Wells </h2><p> The importance of safe and adequate drinking water supplies for rural areas can never be over emphasized. The State Government is alive to the need for potable water in villages and is implementing a programme for digging borewells and fitting them with handpumps. UNICEF is also extending help to the State Government's programme. However, much of the anticipated benefits have been mitigated by a large number of breakdowns. In Phase-I of the project, failure modes of existing designs of handpumps were analyzed and an improved design was evolved. Using an accelerated testing rig, this new handpump was tested and the design passed on to the Public Health Engineering Department, Government of Karnataka.</p><p> It was also felt that a strict quality control and an effective maintenance system was the only solution for increasing mean time between failures. It was felt that if a pump that would u se standard parts could be designed, the variation in the quality would be mininum. </p><h2>3. Water Lifting Devices for Irrigation </h2><p> At least 25% of the 5000 new wells that are being dug every year in Karnataka are fitted with traditional water lifting devices such as the Yatha, Kapile or Persian Wheel, operated by human or animal power. The lift capacity of such devices is limited to about 1 meter for human powered devices, and 10 metres for bullock-powered devices, with discharge in the range of 9,000-18,000 litres/hour. The centrifugal pumps used for water lifting for irrigation can pump about 35,000 litres/hour, but in majority of cases, this capacity exceeds the yield of the well. There is, therefore, a need for water lifting devices capable of handling a range of lifts from 1 to 10 metres and delivering upto about 25, 000 litres/hour. </p><p> Two different designs of water lifting devices had been taken up for investigation under this project. One of these is based on the Archimedian screw and the other is based on the diaphragm pump utilizing two scooter tyres. The objective is to design, fabricate and carry out tests on these two versions with a view to establish their feasibility or otherwise as human or animal powered water lifting devices for purposes of minor irrigation. </p><h2>4. Ground Water Recharge through Percolation Tanks in the West Coast Region of Karnataka </h2><p> The West Coast region of Karnataka is characterised by lateritic soils with a high coefficient of permeability. A large number of irrigation wells with good yields are found in the region. The water table remains high till around February because of the heavy rainfall during the monsoon. However, by March, a shortage of water is felt, probably because of heavy pumping and also due to groundwater drainage into the sea. A project was therefore initiated to study the feasibility of recharging the groundwater by constructing surface ponds and reducing run off during the monsoons. </p><p> Recharging of groundwater has been practiced in Maharastra since around 1950 through what are known as 'Percolation tanks' and in Rajasthan for even longer by menas of 'rapats'. The recharging involves building an earth dam (percolation tank) or a stone or concrete dam (rapat) across a stream. In the former case, a waste weir is provided to pass surplus discharge, and in the latter case, the surplus flows over the rapat itself. Unlike conventional tanks and dams, no irrigation canals are provided. Part of the water stored behind the dam evaporates and part of it percolates into the ground. As a result of the percolation, the water table as well as the well yield rises downstream of the dam. In order to facilitate the percolation, a full cut-off wall is not provided as in conventional dams. </p><p> In the first phase of the project various sand bed laboratory models for studying the percolation phenomenon were built. In these experiments two layers of sand of different permeability's were used to stimulate the ratio of permeability's (of the surface soil to the laterite at the water-bearing level) as found in the coastal region of Karnataka. The models built were capable of stimulating a dam at any one of the three positions along its length. </p><p> A two dimensional theory for explaining and predicting various percolation parameters was developed. </p><p> The designed storage capacity of the percolation tank is 20,000 cubic meters and the total submerged area would be 2 hectares of practically barren forest land. Using the theory for percolation developed in phase 1 of the project, it is predicted that the tank would improve the irrigation potential from well downstream in 40 hectares of cultivated land by making available 4,5000 cubic meters of additional water. Apart from increasing the irrigation potential, the tank could provide water for reforestation activities on the largely denuded upper slopes of the tank area as well as on some slopes downstream. </p><p> Another important benefit of the project is the reduction of reverse diffusion of seawater in the soil, occurring now as a result of over exploitation of wells and thereby prevent salinization of ground water and irrigated surface soils. It would also help in increasing drinking water supply during the lean summer season. </p><h2>5. Improvement in Estimation Methodology for Ground Water Prediction </h2><p> Water is a key component of the agricultural system. Availability of assured and adequate supply of water makes for improvement in agricultural productivity. In regions which are not at present serviced by large irrigation schemes, lift irrigation by means of irrigation wells and the like is essential for such growth. Such regions are quite a few in Karnataka. It is here that we are faced with the problem of ground water. The uncertainty of prediction of a certain assured quantum of water is so high as to render, not too infrequently, such investments uneconomical. It has been established that whereas groundwater availablility can be predicted with a probability of 0.8, quantity of groundwater available can be predicted with an associated probability of only 0.5. </p><p> The Department of Mines &amp; Geology, Government of Karnataka, has maintained detailed case histories of more than 1,500 wells drilled over the last two years; less detailed data base is available for a few more years. It was felt that this size of data would be sufficient for developing computer software which could be used for evaluation of fresh data, thereby improving the probability of success for prediction of quantity of groundwater. </p><h2>6. Conservation of Surface and Ground Water </h2></p> Streams, canals and wells irrigate only about 15% of the total agricultural land in Karnataka. Farmers in 85% of the cultivated land depend entirely on rainfall. Droughts being a frequent phenomenon, a need to develop measures to conserve both surface and subsurface water was felt. </p><p> During the year 1985-86 the surface water conservation aspect was studies with reference to dry land agriculture. The study was conducted at 'Ungra' village using a farm pond. This pond was dug to ensure supply of water to rainfed crops at crucial stages of growth. A comparison between yields of ragi gram in these plots and in those which depended on rain alone, revealed that the grain and straw yield was more, by 60 to 80 percent irrespectively in the irrigated plots. Allowing for the cost of excavation of pond, the loss of crop revenue from the area occupied by the pond, and ignoring the fodder value of the increased straw yield, the net benefit was the order of Rs. 300 per hectare. If the seepage and evaporation losses could be reduced, the same pond could irrigate more area. The project was further pursued on the following two lines: </p><ol><li> An analytical study on farm ponds as surface water conservation structures, for regular or life saving irrigation, for dry crops was undertaken, and </li><li> An experimental study on the effect of land treatment on ground water recharge, was also carried our </li></ol><h2>7.

These are ponds paved with stones on the banks and gradually sloping towards the centre. Kalyanis constructed near temples called Pushkaranis play very important role in socio-religious and cultural activities of Indian tradition and as a storage reservoir to supply water for temples. Apart from the sanctity attached to them, these ponds help to recharge the wells in and around the area. That was one of the reasons for the ancient rulers to allot funds for their development and maintenance. Traditionally, where the rainfall was relatively low, every effort was made to retain all the water that fell on the ground through appropriate water retention and conservation strategies like Kalyanis. </p><p> Now most of the kalyanis are in a state of disuse and in dilapidation. This study attempts to assess the present status of Kalyanis and suggest scientific measures for their rejuvenation in different agro-climatic zones of the state. </p><p> In the present study, an attempt will be made to investigate the hydro-geological, lithological, geomorphological status of Kalyanis in 3 districts (Tumkur, Hassan and Bagalkot) of different agro-climatic zones of the state through field work and application of advanced scientific tools like Geographic Information System (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS) and Remote Sensing. </p><h3> Objectives </h3><ul>	<li>To survey and map the location of Kalyanis using GPS technology</li>	<li>To create the digital database both spatial & non spatial database on various parameters and hyperlink the present photographs using Geospatial technology.</li>	<li>To assess the present status, storage capacity, run off inflow, catchment area, siltation and Discharge</li>	<li>To ascertain the status and sources of pollution and analyze the water quality</li>	<li>To provide scientific remedial measures for rejuvenation based on its location, Physical status, geo-hydrological status and usage.</li></ul><p> The results serve as a first hand information on current status of Kalyanis to user agencies like Panchayat Raj Engineering department, Zilla Panchayath, Muzrai Department and District administration for better planning, monitoring and implementation of developmental activities to undertake the rejuvenation and revival works of the kalyanis for sustainable development of the area. The Council has contacted the Chief Executive Officers of the concerned district to provide the detailed list of villages and their kalyanis. The project team will visit each Kalyani and collect the relevant details.</p><h2>12.

The survey would concentrate on a sizeable number of households serviced by Bangalore Water Supply &amp; Sewerage Board and the main focus was to concentrate on water consumption data and its analysis in Hebbal area.</p><p> The analysis of the data collected resulted in a comparative study of water supply and demand patterns between Sydney, Australia and Bangalore and the highlights are:</p><p> Sydney has a population of 4.12 million spread over 12,428 km2. On the other hand, Bangalore has a population of 8.47 million spread over 741 km2. In terms of sources of water supply, while Sydney gets most of the water from surface water sources, Bangalore gets its water both from surface and groundwater sources. In addition, in the case of Bangalore, there is a considerable amount of water demand met by rainwater harvesting and private tanker supplies. The average water consumption for Sydney is about 293 L/capita/day. On the other hand the average quantity of town water supply to the Bangalore residents (who do not have access to other supplies) is about 190 L/capita/day. This was further reduced to 110 L/capita/day for the households who have access to additional sources such as bore well, rainwater harvested and / or private tanker waters. It appears that the Bangalore water supply system is relatively more decentralised than the Sydney water supply system. </p><h3> Project Completion: </h3><p> Data collected successfully and submitted to University of Western Sydney, Australia.
