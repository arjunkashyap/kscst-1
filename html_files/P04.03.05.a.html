<h2>Progress</h2>
<h3>First Decade (1992-2002)</h3>
<p>At the local level, necessary institutional changes were brought about during this period to ensure people's participation in the planning process. As per the provisions of the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, different State Governments constituted a three tier system of local bodies at district (Zilla Panchayath), block (Panchayath Samiti) and village (Gram Sabha) levels at rural areas and Municipalities (Nagarpalikas) at urban areas. Mandates of such local level bodies are to collect revenues, draw up and implement integrated development schemes. The VIII 5 Year- Plan (1990-95) of Planning Commission suggested that the developmental plans should be drawn up at the local level (district and below) taking into account the physical and human endowments of the area, felt needs of the people and funds available .Entry of GIS in India during late 80's and launching of Indian Remote Sensing Satellite during 1987 guided the evolution of the NRDMS programme during this decade. The programme was looked upon as a major initiative for introduction of Geospatial technologies and tools in the local level planning of the State.</p>
<p>In this context, the goals were focused towards :</p>
<ol>
	<li>Development of spatial data management technologies for integrated rural development planning and</li>
	<li>Demonstration of utility of spatial data tools in local level decision making. Adoption of Geographical Information System (GIS) as the core of NRDMSmethodology for locale specific problem solving was made explicit. Forging linkages with users at different levels was introduced as one of the objectives for dissemination of NRDMS methodology.</li>
</ol>

</ol>



<h3>Activities of district NRDMS centre activities during 2009-10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>District level user interaction workshops have been conducted on &quot;Web based Geographic Information System&quot; to create awareness among end user in the utility of geospatial database through Internet. During these workshops the utility of the GeoPortal was demonstrated to the end users for planning and management of resources. The Council conducted district level workshops in twenty four districts of the State. The activities of the NRDMS program and the web based GeoPortal evoked good response among the district officials. Several requests were received during the workshop to take up activities utilizing geospatial technologies to developmental programs and also to provide a detailed technical / project reports to plan the resources and infrastructure.</li>
	<li>The NRDMS Centres have prepared Technical reports containing basic information and arrangements made in Bye-Elections - 2005 as well as Gram Panchayath elections held during 2009-10. The work involved generating Legislative Assembly / Gram Panchayath constituency wise location and jurisdiction of polling stations with numbers and type of polling booths along with route maps to carry polling personnel and materials as required by election authorities, Election Commission and Observers.</li>
	<li>Preparation of Status report on rainfall, crops, ground water table in comparison with previous years and drinking water facilities.</li>
	<li>Detailed project report as per the requirement of Sericulture department on mulberry cultivation and projected area of its cultivation by the year 2020.</li>
	<li>Prepared Project Implementation Programme report under Total Sanitation Campaign project of Government of India. The report included necessary inputs for TSC program by incorporating drinking water and sanitation facilities of villages selected under this programme.</li>
	<li>District centres have been continuously supporting both central and state supported development programs like NREGA, Backward Region Grant Fund (BRGF), Suvarna Gramodaya program, Integrated Wastelands Development Programme (IWDP), National Watershed Development Programme in Rain fed Area (NWDPRA) and NABARD assisted watershed program etc.</li>
	<li>Crime mapping of several City Municipalities for based on intensity of crime, availability of police stations etc.</li>

In several districts the habitations are wide spread, and these habitations are connected to major roads by roads called link roads. This study indicated the current status of various categories of roads, their connectivity to habitations and other related matters regarding the road network of especially coastal districts. Nearly 30% of the road finance goes for road development in these districts. This project is mainly carried out to focus mainly on rural road network connectivity.</li>
	<li>Postal Code mapping with region and limits of Post office for several North Karnataka districts.</li>
	<li>Technical support to district planning in resource mapping using high resolution satellite imageries, GPS etc., specifically in Gulbarga, Dakshina Kannada, Gadag, Tumkur and Chitradurga.</li>
	<li>NRDMS centres are providing analysed spatial information to support district planning activities mainly in the areas of education, health, infrastructure, watersheds based on local specific problems.</li>
	<li>Preparation of safer zone for Stone crushing in several districts of the state for Mines and Geology department based on the guidelines provided by the district authorities.</li>
	<li>Water quality and quantity analysis for the State has been taken up and the Council has completed the generation of spatial maps for few selected districts under Jal Nirmal program.</li>
	<li>Digital Tourism ATLAS for the state of Karnataka showing tourist information like religious place / water falls / hill stations / adventure sport / national parks / bird sanctuary / monuments / forts / reservoirs etc., has been completed.</li>
	<li>NRDMS centres are providing analysed spatial information to support district planning activities mainly in the areas of education, health, infrastructure, watersheds based on local specific problems etc.</li>
