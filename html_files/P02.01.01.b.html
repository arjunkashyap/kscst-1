<h2> Genesis of KSCST</h2>

<ul>
	<li> Recognition of the need to address problems and issues of segments of our society, particularly the rural and the urban poor not in the purview of Science &amp; Technology [S &amp; T] initiatives, the strong emotional appeal, touching a soft chord of every human being particularly scientists and technologists created the initiative.</li>
	<li> To sensitize the S&amp;T community to such problems, visionaries in Indian Institute of Science [I.I.Sc.] and the Government of Karnataka [GOK] have established the Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology [KSCST] during September 1975.</li>
	<li> Since then KSCST has been endeavoring to play the role of a catalytic agent for promoting the use of S &amp; T products and services in the development process of the state.</li>
