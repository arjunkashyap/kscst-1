<h1>Rainwater Harvesting</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> Water is one of the most commonly used substances on our earth. We need water for all our activities in day-to-day life. Water supply in urban area is always short against the total demand. Surface water is inadequate to meet our demand and we have to depend on ground water. Due to rapid urbanization, infiltration of rainwater into the subsoil has decreased drastically and recharging of ground water has diminished. This scenario requires an alternative source to bridge the gap between demand and supply. Rainwater, which is easily available and is the purest form of water, would be an immediate source to augment the existing water supply by &quot;catching water wherever it falls&quot;.</p>
<p> Rainwater Harvesting has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional perennial sources of water in hilly areas, in places where the level of fluoride and arsenic is above permissible limits and in urban areas facing water shortage and flooding during monsoons.</p>
<p> Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) is the process of collecting and storing rainwater in a scientific and controlled manner for future use. Rainwater Harvesting in urban areas include</p>
<ul>
	<li>Roof top rainwater harvesting</li>
	<li> Rainwater harvesting in paved and un-paved areas (open fields, parks, pavement landscapes etc.)</li>
	<li> Rainwater Harvesting in large areas with open ponds, lakes, tanks etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Success Stories - KSCST</h3>
<p>Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology (KSCST) is the first state council in the country to be established to address science and technology issues of the state. Council has established RWH in twenty landmark buildings and four exhibition plots for demonstration of cost effective and sustainable RWH and ground water recharge technologies at Bangalore and Tumkur such as Vidhana Soudha, BBMP head office, BWSSB - BSK field office, Fire station, Beedy workers colony, RTO office, Pollution Control Board, Deputy Commissioner's office etc. Over thirty RWH training programmes for various target groups covering Planners, Architects, Engineers, Contractors, Plumbers, Masons etc., have been conducted. In addition several awareness camps in different wards of Bangalore and Tumkur were also organized. </p>
<p>To cover all the districts of Karnataka, Council has established RWH resource and training center for the southern states at Mahatma Gandhi Regional Institute for Rural Energy and Development in Bangalore and District RWH Nodal Centers at all the 27 districts in the state. Technical support is also being provided in establishing RWH system in 176 villages (one each in every taluk of Karnataka) and 23,680 rural schools in the state (probably the world's largest RWH project) a programme of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, Government of Karnataka. Over 10,000 people from Bangalore and other parts of Karnataka have availed technical support on Rainwater Harvesting from the Council.</p>
<p>Individuals and Institutions can contact Rainwater Harvesting Cell at KSCST for technical advice, planning and project implementation.</p>
<p>A.R. Shivakumar is the Principal Investigator RWH and Scientist at the State Council. He has been associated with Environment and Renewable energy related programmes and projects since 1982. He has five innovations to his credit. The Government of India recognized one of his innovations and has a National Award conferred on him during 2002.</p>
