<h1>Energy Projects - 1</h1><h2>1. Utilization of Sludge Gas</h2><p> There are two primary sewage treatment plants in Bangalore, one at Belur-Nagasandra Village near HAL and the other at Nayandanahalli on the Mysore Road, 11 km from Bangalore. The Belur plant has a processing capacity of 36 million gallons/day while the Mysore road plant has a capacity of 27 MGD. At present, the large volume of combustible gas produced at these plants is being flared. Recognising that the gas is a potential source of inexpensive and presently unutilised energy, KSCST initiated a project on the utilisation of sludge gas. In the first phase of the study, the Working Group investigated the utilisation options for the Belur plant. A preliminary survey indicated that there were three potential users - HAL ( 7 km. approximately), Indiranagar (8 km. approximately) and NAL Wind Tunnel Center (1 km. approximately). The economics of utilisation favour a single user close to the digestor since piping costs can be kept at a minimum. Since the functioning of the NAL Wind Tunnel Center is severely restricted due to shortage of power, and efforts are being made to double the energy supply NAL, NAL was identified as the most attractive user for the gas. Preliminary computations indicate that 3 1/2 lakh cft/day of sludge gas should be produced, but actual measurements showed that there were significant leakages. These leaks have not been sealed by BWS &amp; SB. The methane content of the gas is approximately 70% and 3 1/2 lakh cft/day of sludge gas of this composition is equivalent to 2.6 MW continuous supply of thermal energy.</p>
      <h2>2. Formulation of a Wind Energy Programme for Karnataka</h2><p> Wind, as a renewable source of energy, has not been exploited in any significant measure. Except in the case of a few European Countries, wind energy accounts for a negligible fraction of the total spectrum of energy consumption in most countries. However, this scenario is changing, albeit very gradually. Apart from the 'energy crisis' (the focus have being the conventional energy resources), there are a number of socio-economic factors that provide the rationale for a search for new energy resources and for an increased emphasis on the hitherto non-conventional sources of power. These factors are all the more pertinent for an underdeveloped country such as India. Given the criteria of cost-effectiveness, they necessitate a system of energy generation, distribution and consumption that is an optimal mix of centralised and decentralised mechanism and draw upon both conventional and non-conventional energy resources.</p><p> The study team has completed its work and final reports have been prepared. Based on the analysis of wind data collected from 22 meteorological stations spread over Karnataka, the working group has arrived at certain conclusions.</p><p> It is proposed to pursue the project into a follow-up phase with the aim of concentrating on these specific jobs. Salient among these recommendations are :</p><ol>	<li> Set up wind measurement station in at least one of the relatively windier districts (Bangalore, Bidar, Gulbarg and Raichur) to obtain a detailed wind data. This is necessary to obtain a better estimate of the annual energy, flux in the wind and also to ascertain the likely output that can be expected out of any windmill. </li>	<li> Initiate developmental work on windmill systems for water pumping (the system includes rotors, towers, pumps and load-matching devices) </li>	<li> Set up windmills of different designs om certain areas of the state where both the availability of and the demand for the wind energy are likely to be high. </li>	<li> Identify possibilities of using windmills as a source of energy for multiple activities in rural areas. </li>	<li> Carry out an intensive wind survey in the State to identify favourable windy sites where large scale extraction of wind energy may be possible. </li></ol>          <h2>3. Design, Fabrication &amp; Trial of Wind Pump with 10,000 Litres/Hour Pumping Capacity </h2><p> The KSCST has completed a major project on 'Utilisation of Wind Energy in Karnataka' with specific stress on the prospects of exploiting wind energy in Karnataka, the characterisation of windmills available for rural use and their performance studies. This study suggested that the spread of windmills in rural areas would require the design and construction of windmills with a suitably load-matched pump that will provide an output of about 10,000 litres/hour at average wind speed of 10 kms/hour. Such a project was initiated by KSCST.</p><p> The project aims at developing a wind pump to pump water:</p><ol>	<li> for irrigation purposes after the monsoon in the windier districts of Karnataka and</li>	<li> for supplementary irrigation during mid-monsoon droughts.</li> </ol>
      <h2>4. Microhydel Power Generation in Karnataka</h2>
    <p> Karnataka's power needs are supplied almost exclusively by hydroelectricity. large hydroelectric plants are normally sited in places where the impounded flow and available head are of sufficient magnitude to make the power economically attractive. There are however, innumerable other sources of hydroenergy of smaller magnitude.</p><p> Two important sources of minihydro power in Karnataka are the drops present in the extensive irrigation system and the seasonal and perennial streams in the Western Ghats. These two sources provide the possibility of decentralised power supply. These additional sources were considered uneconomical from the point of view of exploitation for general purposes, except in the case of remote communities or estates where the cost of distribution from a central grid would be prohibitive. With the increase in the cost of energy, resulting from the oil crisis, it has become worthwhile to pursue the possibility of utilising the smaller hitherto neglected hydroelectric resources.</p>

<h2>5. Energy Planning for Karnataka State</h2><p> The &quot;power crisis&quot; in Karnataka is likely to be a fairly long-term problem of the State. This situation demands an in-depth analysis of the entire energy problem of Karnataka. Initially, this analysis may be restricted to electrical energy, the planning of which involves two aspects, namely, generation and utilisation. KSCST, therefore, initiated a project on the distribution and consumption of LT (less than 11 KV) electrical energy.</p><p> The studies have shown that electrification of backward taluks leads only to a marginal development. Only 9 - 10% of the population of electrified villages can afford domestic connections. The irrigation potential is not fully exploited, probably due to lack of access to credit for small farmers. Over 30% of Karnataka's landholdings are below 0.73 hectares whereas Land Banks require 0.6 to 1.0 hectares as security (collateral) for advancing credit for pumpsets. Industries, large, medium and also small, have proliferated only in cities and prosperous taluks. The average increase in motive power has been 50 HP/year in backward taluks, providing new employment to only 6 people/year.</p><p> Time lag for utilisation of the available power is indefinitely large for backward taluks. Only a few advancing taluks, power is used up as soon as it becomes available.</p><p> Electrification leads to development of backward areas only when the increase of utilisation of electrical energy in irrigation and industry are planned for simultaneously.</p><h2>6. Activated Carbon from Coconut Shells </h2>  <p> Activated carbons are the carbons with active sites capable of adsorbing, sometimes preferentially, many organic molecules. These active sites are created by certain standardised procedures and treatments. It is possible to have activated carbons with hydrophilic and lyophilic surfaces, capable of increased adsorption of water and other polar organic vapours, and with an acid surface suitable for removal of ammonia and other alkaline pollutants from industrial effluents. It is also possible to impart benzophilic and aromatic surfaces for improved benzene adsorption.</p><p> The bulk of the activated carbon is used either in liquid phase (mostly decolorisation and effluent treatment) or vapour phase (air pollution abatement, recovery and removal of organic compounds from industrial off gases.</p><p> The activated carbons are, in general, obtained by conventional two step process of carbonisation and activation. These steps are carried out either in two different units or a single unit. But it is more economical to have the carbonised near the raw material site and the activator near the market site.</p><p> Coconut shells serve as an excellent source of raw material for the manufacture octivated carbon. Since coconut shells are abundantly available in Karnataka, the feasibility of making activated carbon from coconut shells was explored. </p> <h2>7. Wood Gas Generators and their use in Engines less than 10 HP</h2><p> Development of technologies for use of renewable sources of energy for generation of motive power has acquired significant status in the current years especially in wake of the petroleum crisis. One of the forms of use of renewable energy sources is converting wood into woodgas by a process of controlled combustion. The woodgas so generated can be used to replace liquid fuels in internal combustion engines. There was a technology gas in the development of wood gasifiers for use in small engines.</p><p> The project spans two phases of which the design and fabrication of a wood gasifier was limited to phase I.</p><p> This wood gasifier generates about 3-6 litres/sec. of wood gas with typical composition of carbon monoxide (20%), hydrogen (20%), carbon dioxide (10%), and nitrogen (50%). This woodgas when fed into an internal combustion engine, replaces about 80% of diesel in a normal diesel engine and almost 100% of kerosene in a petrol started kerosene driven engine. The woodgasifier was fabricated and tested in a laboratory before taking it into the field. It was felt necessary that the system will have to be modified so that it could be made suitable for live rural applications.</p><p> Hence phase II of the project was initiated with the following objectives:</p><ol>	<li> Re-design the gas generator for easier handling under field conditions.</li>	<li> Fabrication, long duration testing and validation of the system.</li>	<li> Demonstration of the system at one or two field sites. </li>	<li> Consideration of choice of alternative fuels like compressed biomass, etc. </li></ol>
          <h2>8. Development of Wood Stoves</h2><p> It was found that the dimensional features of a woodstove are of paramount importance in establishing its efficiency. Besides, the presence of a grate in woodstoves makes the burning of wood easier The cooking pan creates an enclosed space, and the gases are let out through a stack, thus, doing away with the problem of smoke without altering the thermal efficiency.</p><p> The development of a woodstove which incorporates these features would have a significant effect on a large segment of the rural population, which continue to use wood and twigs for fuel.</p><p> KSCST initiated a project with the objectives of developing woodstoves which would not require drastically different cooking practices compared to the practice with traditional stoves, will have a thermal efficiency much higher than 30% (compared to the less than 10% efficiency of traditional stoves) will be smokeless, and amongst other things promote the utilisation of local materials to keep the cost low.</p><p> The present cookstove is ideal for this two stage process of cooking The first stage involves the raising of the temperature of food in the cooking vessel to boiling point. The second stage being with the stoppage of wood burning and the supply of stored heat from the stove body to maintain the temperature of the cooking food near its boiling point.</p><p> Experiments, using this method, have shown that as low as 60 to 80 grams of fuelwood are required , for obtaining 1 kgm of cooked food, as compared to 300 to 500 gms needed for good quality traditional stoves.</p><h2>9. Generation of Electricity from Municipal Wastes: A Preliminary Survey</h2>
<p> Bangalore city, with its fast growing rate of growth has been having a considerable problem of disposal of its garbage. This disposal of garbage and its possible utilisation for generation of energy has been an idea which the city planners have been exploring for quite sometime. The city corporation has received several proposals for utilisation of garbage, prominent of them being for:</p><ol>	<li>Anaerobic digestion to generate methane gas</li>	<li>Incineration to generate heat.</li></ol><h2>10. Demonstration of Low Cost Solar Water Heating System for Domestic Purpose</h2><p>Considerable savings in energy can be achieved where there is a requirement for hot water for a household to put up a system to heat 100 litres of water per day at 500C - 600C. This high cost has prevented large scale acceptance of solar hot water systems.</p>
 <h2>11. Design &amp; Development of 100 kW Gasifier for Diesel Genset</h2>    <p>Supply of electrical energy by utilisers generally lags behind the demand, forcing the utilities to impose power cuts. A number of industries have gone ahead with installing captive diesel based power generation equipment. However, it is possible to generate electricity using wood, which is a renewable resource. Experience gained by the scientists working on an earlier project of development of small (3.7 kW) wood gasifier had shown that wood gasifiers at a scale of 100 kW could be developed and the gas used in diesel engines can save about 70% of diesel. The KSCST initiated a project at the Indian Institute of Science to proceed with the design and fabrication of one unit. In March 1986 the proposal was ratified and the project work commenced on 1st April 1986. By April 1`987 a prototype wood gasifier was developed. This was demonstrated at the meeting of scientists from various laboratories, working on wood gasifiers. Seeing the potential of this developed system, the Department of Non Conventional Energy Sources requested KSCST to design and develop a complete a package for a 100 kW gasifier based power plant to be installed at Andaman and Nicobar islands, a place having vast wood resources and hitherto depending only on diesel for its power needs. Moreover, these islands have an abundance of plantations and hence wood gasifier may not lead to destruction of Rain forests particularly since the device would operate on waster materials from saw mills. With this in mind, this demonstration project was started on 1st April 1988 and in January 1989 the 100 kW system, named as SIGMA-100 (Science Institute Gasifier for Multiple Applications - 100 kW) was dispatched to Andaman and Nicobar islands.</p>
        
<h2>12. Desimination/ Demonstration of Swosthee in Karnataka</h2>      <p> Traditional cooking stoves have a low thermal efficiency of around 15%. From the early days the Council has been striving to provide Karnataka's house wife with a low cost alternative stove which would cook at higher efficiencies and would not demand drastic changes in cooking practices. Efforts in this direction resulted in Astra Ole, a three pan smokeless stove which can be constructed using locally available materials. Its efficiency is around 40% and nearly 2 lakh such stoves are now in use in Karnataka.</p><p> From extensive field and regular feed back it was noticed that this stove had two inherent features :</p><ol>	<li> It is not portable, is constructed in situ;</li>	<li> All the three pans had to be used to achieve the high efficiency claimed.</li></ol><h2>13. Astra Ole Diffusion Programme</h2><p> In Karnataka 80% of the rural energy needs are met by fuel wood. Most of the traditional domestic wood burning stoves are not very efficient and use only 10-15% of the head provided by burning the fuel wood. A smokeless, 3 pan efficient stove, was developed. The stove has an efficiency of 40-50% if properly constructed and used. The stove has been named ASTRA OLE.</p> <p> The stove is essentially built using bricks and mud, at homes of the users. It has a chimney and a few metal lids. The Government of Karnataka adopted the stove for propogation under the centrally sponsored 'National Project on Demonstration of Improved Chulas'.</p><p> In order to construct Astra Ole in villages, the KSCST had adopted a two tier training programme. A batch of 19 project Assistants, one for each district, was trained for 15 days of Ungra Extension Center of the I.I.Sc., in Astra Ole construction. These project Assistants were then moved to different districts to carry out training of local artisans. The training camps were of 12 days duration, had about 16 artisans per camp and 50 to 60 stoves were built during each camp. So far 4,245 artisans have been trained in the State. The stoves which were built initially under NPDIC, are now built under other schemes such as People Housing Scheme, National Rural Employment Programme, Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme etc. Each stove carries a subsidy of Rs. 75 from the Government. KSCST has produced a 16 mm colour documentary film on Astra Ole in Kannada and the film has been given to each district head quarters.</p><p> A census survey was initiated in nine talukas in the State to assess the field performance of the stove. It was found that about 20% of the stoves were not functioning well.</p><p> An evaluation of fuel consumption and user response was conducted in three different food zones in the State, namely ragi zone, jowar zone and rice zone. Nearly 75% of the houses in the jowar zone prefer 2 pan stoves instead of the 3 pan stoves.</p><p> However in the ragi zone, only 42% of the users preferred a two pan stove. With regard to the performance of the stove, more than 75% of the users felt that cooking with Astra Ole takes less time, consumes less fuel and there is no smoke in the kitchen. The users also indicated the inability of the stove to accept vessels of widely differing size, as a problem.</p><h2>14. Urjagram</h2><p>The Urjagram Scheme has been conceived as a way of developing villages to a stage where most of the energy needs of the village are met by renewable sources. The emphasis is on maximising the use of locally available resources, preferably the renewable ones.</p><p> The first Urjagram in Karanataka was established at Bollapura village in Khurki Mandal Panchayat in Davangere taluk. The Urjagram was inaugurated on 2nd October 1989.</p><p> It was decided to split the Urjagram implementation into two phases. The first phase envisaged the introduction of Astra Oles in the village which till now was using traditional stoves. The midday meal scheme was revived where a community solar cooker and a large ole have been installed. A wood gasifier was given to a user in the village to demonstrate the concept. The Bollapura proper is an isolated settlement. It was felt that a TV set could be introduced in the village using solar and wind energy sources. A novel idea of feeding a centralized battery source through an integrated supply from a rutland 50 watt windcharger and solar photovoltaic panels has been attempted. The battery sources supplies electricity for the community TV and a street light. The TV is housed in the village temple cum community hall.</p><h2>14a. Community Biogas Plant at Pura for Water Pumping &amp; Illumination</h2><p> It is reported that only about 10% of Karnataka's Electrical Energy flows to rural areas, and that, even when villages are electrified, less than 10% of their households obtain domestic connections. These connections are solely for the purpose of lighting, and the requirements of cooking are almost are never considered in conventional planning, though this accounts for almost 90% of the energy consumption in villages. Rural folk, therefore, have to use the so-called 'non-commercial' fuels, viz., the main fire wood, dung cakes and vegetables wastes. Where firewood is the main source of cooking fuel, its gathering becomes a major activity this crucial household chore. But, fuel wood is becoming scarce with the increasing felling of trees resulting in the chore becoming more and more difficult. In this context, the provision of cooking energy needs becomes a very important development task.</p><p> One approach to this problem is to step up centralised energy production, and to set up transmission lines to villages even if they are remote from the grid. This approach involves heavy investments, long gestation times; and quite often, it does not yield adequate returns.</p><p> Another approach is to make maximum use of locally available renewable energy sources. One such explorable resource is the large amount of cattle-dung produced in a village. This dung can be anaerobically fermented in biogas plants (gobar gas plants) to yield a combustible biogas fuel in addition to a sludge which serves as an excellent fertilizer. Though such an idea is superficially attractive, it is important to examine the feasibility of the biogas approach to decentralized rural energy supplies.</p><p> In order to obtain an understanding of energy consumption patterns in rural areas, a detailed survey was carried out in six villages in Kunigal Taluk, Tumkur District. The survey was designed to provide information on</p><ol>	<li> The population of village; </li>	<li> The number of households;</li>	<li> The number of cattle excluding goats and sheep;</li>	<li> The amount of dung collected in the houses;</li>	<li> The consumption of Kerosene for illumination, of water for drinking and other household uses, and of firewood for cooking fuel;</li>	<li> The efficiency of village stoves (5%);</li>	<li> The species of wood used in the villages as firewood etc.,</li></ol><p> Simultaneously, an experimental biogas plant was set up in the Indian Institute of Science and operated since the end of 1976 to obtain reliable information of gas yields, gas composition, Nitrogen content of sludge etc., over 18 months of operation. This experimental plant showed the following performance :</p><ol>	<li> 34 cm3 of biogas per g. of wet dung,</li>	<li> Biogas composition : 80% methane and 40% carbon dioxide,</li>	<li> 2.16% Nitrogen in biogas sludge.</li></ol><p> The village of Pura was then chosen for feasibility study . Pura with a population of about 340 and 60 households, and a cattle population of about 146 has a wet dung availability of about 1,350 kgs. per day corresponding to an estimated biogas yield of about 45 cubic meters per day. Preliminary estimates indicate that this gas production is sufficient to meet all the cooking energy needs of the village which currently requires 570 kgs. of firewood per day, and leave enough gas to run a Kirloskar 5 HP biogas engine for several hours for compressing gas for pipeline distribution, for lifting water for house-hold water requirements, for electricity generation, etc.,</p><h2>15 Development of Woodstoves for Domestic Cooking</h2><p> This project was initiated with the objective to design and fabricate a thermally efficient wood burning stove. The design constraints imposed included:</p><ol>	<li> The improved woodstoves should require similar cooking practices as used in traditional stoves;</li>	<li> The woodstove should be smokeless;</li>	<li> It should be possible to vary the woodstove dimensions to take care of different sizes of vessels.</li></ol><p> A new three pan stove was designed and fabricated during 1983 which incorporated the above requirements. In water boiling experiments this stove yielded Percentage Heat Utilisation (PHU) of 40% and specific fuel consumption (SFC) of 120 to 180 gms of wood per kg of food cooked.</p><p> This three pan stove has been christened as &quot;Astra Ole&quot;. Its acceptability was ascertained by field test in Ungra area. The Government of Karnataka adopted this stove for propagation under the national project on Demonstration of Improved Chulas. It was felt that using the same heat transfer concepts large sized stoves for canteens, hotels, hostels and also a two pan stove for urban use was developed.</p><p> During the first phase of the project a domestic wood stove for cooking, with a high thermal efficiency, christened 'Astra Ole' was developed. Some of its important characteristics are somkelessness, savings in wood and cooking time and elimination of fire hazards. This stove is suitable for a family size of 5-8 members. The stove is constructed in situ using locally available material such as sand, brick, rice husk, and some pre-fabricated items. </p><p> Development of large woodstoves was initiated. The objective was to design and develop a 3 pan cooking stove for large scale applications which would accommodate vessels of different sizes and shapes. In addition to the cooking stove, a bath water heating stove has also been designed.</p>
