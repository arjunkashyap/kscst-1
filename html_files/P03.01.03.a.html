<h1>Building Technology Projects</h1><h2>1. A Study of Soil in and around Hassan for Lime Stabilized Brick Making</h2><p> Five different soils from Tannerhalla, Hassan Polytechnic, Bettadpura, Holenarasipura and MCE Campus, Hassan have been analysed. The tests conducted are for the Atterberg limits, grain size analysis and swell test. Detailed compaction tests were carried out to find the reactions of these soils to various compositions of lime. 16 cubes were casted with compositions of 5 %, 10% and 15% lime, for a mixing period of 1/2 hours, 1 hour and 2 hours; and were tested after 7 days, 28 days and 90 days of curing. The standard proctor compact test gave the following results. </p><p> The results indicate that as the percentage of lime increases the optimum moisture content increases while the maximum dry density decreases. </p><p> Mixing of lime beyond 1/2 hour does not have an appreciable effect on the increase of dry density. The crushing strength increases with the number of days of curing, of both wet strength and fan dried strength. With the increase in percentage of lime from 5 to 10%, the corresponding crushing strength is much higher, varying from 2 to 6 times that for the 5% lime composition. However, the crushing strength, obtained for these soils are on the lower side, because the percentage of clay in these soils is only 1%. </p><h2>2. Use of Black Cotton Soil for Low Cost Buildings </h2><p> A large fraction of Karnataka's population lives in black cotton (BC) soil areas. Production of bricks using black cotton soil is not possible either by the traditional brick making process or by the pressed soil block process with stabilizers. The black cotton soil blocks crack on drying. Mixing stabilisers with BC soil to press soil blocks crack on drying. Mixing stablisiers with BC soil to press soil blocks proves difficult because the clay tends to form lumps. To overcome these obstacles a project was initiated.</p><p> A successful process of black cotton soil block making was evolved. Lime was used as a stabliser because of its abundance in block cotton soil areas and its low cost. It has a reactive aspect which alters the soil properties to meet the specific engineering qualities viz., volume, stability, wet strength etc. The soil and the stabliser with a high moisture content (20-25% ) were kneaded together and the moulded. The block was then cured.</p><h2>3. Development &amp; Field Testing of New Building Technologies </h2><p> Over the past decades, the following building technologies have been developed in projects supported by the KSCST. </p><ol>	<li> A soil block press - ASTRAM. </li>	<li> Soil Stabilization methods. </li>	<li> Rice husk ash and red mud based cements. </li>	<li> Lime soil plasters for mud walls. </li>	<li> Prefabricated roofs using burnt clay tiles. </li></ol><p>A few of these technologies have been field tested and the rest are being tested in the field. However research in areas like roofing for rural areas has been inadequate. To tackle these issues a new phase of the project on development and field testing of new building technologies was started with Prof. K. S. Jagadish of Indian Institute of Science as the Convener. Initially an improved version of the soil block press with compaction higher by 50% over the earlier model was developed. Production of high grade pozzolana using rice husk and clay was started in Ungra to produce 5 to 6 bags per day. The quality of the product was found to be satisfactory. </p><h2>4. Use of Quarry Wastes for Block Making </h2><p> Stone quarrying is undertaken in various places in Karnataka. The stones which are quarried thus are used for various construction activities. During the quarrying process, rubbles of varying sizes and stone dust are generated. These are rejected. This reject percentage is of the order of 25% of the quarried quantity. An analysis of the reject shows that 50% consists of rubbles greater that 1/2&quot; in size, 25% consists of gravel less than 1/2&quot; in size and the dust forms the remaining 25%. </p><p> A preliminary analysis of the quarry waste showed the possibility of using them for making cement concrete blocks. This would result in low cost blocks with expected savings of upto 30%. To establish the feasibility, a project on use of quarry waste for block making was initiated. </p>
