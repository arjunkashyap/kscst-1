<h1>KSCST : Patent Information Centre</h1>
<p>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) protection plays a key role in gaining an advantageous position in the technology game. Karnataka has seen a huge growth in the past decade and has vast human resources in the field of technology. Bangalore, its capital, has become an acclaimed information technology centre of world repute. In-spite of enjoying such advantages, access to information and other facilities related to IPR is really inadequate here. Information on various technological advancements needs be disseminated to the future developers and creators to help them protect their rights. This has become more pronounced in today's globalised economy with international agreements and obligations. Due diligence is necessary when filing patent applications to ensure full disclosure of the invention. Thus, circumstances warrant awareness about patents and IPR among developers and creators in today's global world.</p>
<p>As a first step in this direction to provide patent related services particularly to the S&amp;T community, Patent Facilitation Centre started functioning under Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council of Department of Science and Technology, Government of India - a few years back. As a state level extension patent information centre was set up at Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore for Karnataka State. The centre started functioning from 31st of March 2005 as a service centre to render IPR related services among S &amp; T community.</p>
<p>Intellectual property is a &quot;Product of Mind&quot;. It is similar to a movable/immovable property which belongs its owner and cannot be lawfully used by others without his permission. World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) provides &quot;Intellectual Property&quot rights for inventions in all fields of human endeavour. It also provides protection against unfair competition and all other rights for safegarding the intellectual property resulting from intellectual activity in the industrial, scientific or artistic fields. The fields of creation includes rights related to works in literary and artistic fields, performance of artists, broadcasts (in the form of CD, DVD, tape recording etc), innovations in science and technology, industrial designs, trade marks, service marks, among others.
