<h2> Understanding Planet Earth</h2>
<h3> Introduction</h3>
<p> The Earth is the only known life-bearing planet in the Solar System. The Earth comprises of mainly four spheres - Lithosphere, Hydrosphere, Atmosphere and Biosphere which correspond to rocks, water, air, and life respectively.</p>
<p> These topics are studied under different branches of science. Geology describes the rocky parts of the Earth's crust (Lithosphere) and its historic development. Geophysicists explore the Earth's core and mantle as well as the tectonic and seismic activity of the lithosphere. Soil science covers the outermost layer of the Earth's crust that is subject to soil formation processes (or Pedosphere). Oceanography and hydrology describe the marine and freshwater domains of the watery parts of the Earth (Hydrosphere). Glaciology covers the icy parts of the Earth (Cryosphere). Atmospheric sciences cover the gaseous parts of the Earth (Atmosphere) between the surface and the exosphere (about 1000 km). Biology is the study of biosphere which consists of all forms of life, from single-celled organisms to pine trees to people. </p>
<p> The atmosphere has five different layers - Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, Thermosphere, and Exosphere; and 75% of the atmosphere's gases are in the bottom-most layer, the troposphere. The atmosphere in which most of human, plant and animal form of life exists, is blanketed by thick layer of gases - 78.0% Nitrogen, 20.9% Oxygen, and 1% Argon. This also contains small amounts of other gases including Carbon-di-oxide and water vapors. Water vapors and CO2 allow the earth's atmosphere to catch and hold the sun's energy through a phenomenon called the greenhouse effect. This allows earth's surface to be warm enough to have liquid water to support life. In addition to storing heat, the atmosphere also protects living organisms by shielding the earth's surface from cosmic rays. The level of protection is high enough to prevent cosmic rays from destroying all life on Earth, yet low enough to aid the mutations that have an important role in pushing forward diversity in the biosphere.</p>
<p> Further due to increased human activities, particularly over the last few centuries, there are vast changes in environment we live in, causing environment imbalance. These changes in environment have detrimental impact on all forms of life on earth - human, animal, plant, marine etc. Environmental Science deals with these aspects, interprets the impact of human actions on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This also encompasses many issues which we are facing such as climate change, global warming, use and conservation of natural resources, biodiversity, water quality, groundwater contamination, soil contamination, waste management, sustainable development, disaster reduction, air pollution, and noise pollution etc.</p>
<p> &quot;Understanding Planet Earth&quot; means study of various aspects (physical, chemical, biological etc) of the planet &quot;Earth&quot; and also about many issues which we are facing due to multifold increase in human activity. With the objective of creating excitement among students in learning, particularly at secondary and higher secondary school level, on study of earth related topics, to clear doubts in the minds of those inquisitive students about these topics and to bring about awareness on various environment related issues, KSCST has planned to organize many programmes. </p>

<h4> <a name="Essay Competition">Essay Competition</a></h4>
<p> KSCST organized essay competition in about 33 Corporation and Government Higher Secondary Schools in Bangalore. As suggested by Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, the theme of competition this year was &quot;Understanding Planet Earth&quot;. Based on this theme, the following topics were given for essay competition: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Water as wealth</li>
	<li>Soil erosion and increasing salinity</li>
	<li>Urban environment problem</li>
	<li>Global warming, an alarm</li>
	<li>Natural and man made threats</li>

	<li>Energy saving</li>
	<li>Wildlife protection</li>
</ul>
<p> The essay competitions were conducted in respective schools during second and third week of February 2008 and were evaluated by teachers themselves. In each of the schools, after due evaluation, essays were selected for first, second and third prizes. In all, 90 students were selected for these prizes.</p>

<h4> <a name="Science Poster Competition">Science Poster Competition</a></h4>
<p> KSCST organized poster competition in February 2008 in which 28 schools participated. The event was conducted in the respective school itself during second and third week of February. Each participating school was provided with financial support to conduct this event. The purpose of this competition was to encourage creative and competitive spirit in students. The theme of competition and topics was same as those of essay competition. In each of the schools, after due evaluation, posters were selected for first, second and third prizes. In all, 84 students were selected for these prizes.</p>

<h4><a name="On-the-Spot painting competition"> On-the-spot Painting Competition</a></h4>
<p> KSCST conducted On-the-spot Painting Competition for two age groups - higher primary school (5th standard to 7th standard) and high school (8th standard to 10th standard). The event was organized on 24th Feb 2008 at the Indian Institute of Science Campus. About 260 students from various primary and high schools in Bangalore city participated in the event. The theme and topics will be same as other competitions. The paintings were evaluated by experts from a local art school in Bangalore. In all 20 paintings were selected for first, second, third and consolation prizes in each group.</p>

<h4><a name="Celebration of National Science Day 2008 and Prize Distribution Function"> Celebration of National Science Day 2008 and Prize Distribution Function</a></h4>
