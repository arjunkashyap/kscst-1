<h1>Environment Projects</h1>
<h2>1. Conservation of Bamboo Resources in Karnataka</h2>
<p> The once abundant bamboo resources of the state of Karnataka have been found to be declining rapidly. With the result the paper industry and the rural consumers are hard hit, and thus a need for rational utilisation of resources arises. Although a lot of work on utilisation and silvicultural aspects of bamboo has been carried out, little has been done on the ecological aspects. The ecological information of bamboo growing in natural conditions were studied.</p>
<p> The study has led to the following recommendations :</p>
<ol>
	
<li> An integrated approach in the management of bamboo resources of the Western Ghats of peninsular India, should be evolved. </li>
	<li> Monitoring of the natural regeneration of bamboo, should be undertaken. </li>           
	<li> Increasing the length of extraction cycles to atleast 4-9 years, should be attempted. </li>
	<li> Retention of culm branches of the clump during extraction, should be enforced. </li>
	<li> A check on the excessive exploitation of resources, should be maintained. </li>
</ol>


<h2>2. Recovery of Copper from Vanadiferrous Magnetite Deposits of Masanikere Areas</h3 >
<p>In the Masanikere area of Shimoga District, there are large deposits of vanadiferrous magnetite ores. The Visveswaraya Iron and Steel Company, Bhadravathi has been using these ores for the extraction of Vanadium, while no efforts are made to extract Copper on account of its low concentration in the ore. Over a few decades high grade copper ores are being fast depleted, resulting in the need for developing technology for the extraction of Copper from these Vanadi ferrous Magnetite Ores.</p>

<h2>3. Environment, Education &amp; Information Service Centre [ENVIS]</h2>
<p> Research in the area of environment and ecology has been unduly restricted to studies on mountain and forest ecosystems, water ecosystems, wild life protection and pollution control. A large percentage of the population of Karnataka, however stays in area which are arid and semi-arid. A systematic attempt has been made to study the ecology of dry lands using simulation and other techniques. </p>


<h2>4. Eradication of weed Parthenium</h2>
<p> A steady increase in the incidence of nasal allergy in Bangalore, suspected to be related to the spread of Parthenium. In previous studies, it has been established that the Parthenium pollen is present in significantly high amounts in Bangalore Atmosphere and is a source of allergic Rhinitis. It is also found that air borne Parthenium pollen causes allergic Contract Dermatitis. Thus it was felt necessary to determine the incidence of naso-brochial allergy in Bangalore population and the role of Parthenium, house dust, etc., in the manifestation of respiratory and skin allergies. </p>
<p> During the 'Open Days' at the Indian Institute of Science (March 2-4, 1985) in connection with the Platinum Jubilee celebrations of the Institute, general public visited various Departments. This opportunity was utilized to conduct, with the help of two clinicians and research students, a random survey of the urban population to determine the incidence of naso-bronchial allergy as well as sensitivity or Parthenium pollen and house dust mite, two dominant air borne allergens in Bangalore.</p>
<p> A booth was set up at the entrance of the Biochemistry Department where 2000 visitors volunteered to participate in this survey. They included school children, college students, housewives, persons employed in various jobs and retired people.</p>
<p> The study of population hailed from different residential areas of Bangalore and represented different economic groups. Thirty percent of the randomly selected persons are females.</p>
<p> After obtaining a brief clinical history on a printed proforma, they were subjected to skin tests to determine their sensitivity to Parthenium pollen and house dust mite. The skin reactions were read and recorded at the exit point where the subjects reached in about 20 minutes. The clinical data thus obtained is being statistically analysed. However, a preliminary examination of the clinical history and allergy skin tests revealed the following:</p>
<p> Thirty percent of the test subjects gave clinical history suggestive of bronchial Asthma. About twenty percent of the survey group complained of nasal problems, mostly rhinitis, characterized by sneezing, watery eyes, running and/or blocked nose. Of the total populations, 5.8 percent and 4.6 percent of the persons suffering from Rhinitis were sensitive respectively to Parthenium pollen and house dust mite as evaluated by allergy skin tests. An additional 33 percent of the population with no clinical symptoms of Rhinitis or Asthma also exhibited positive skin reaction to Parthenium pollen. None of the persons suffering from bronchial Asthama who did not have concurrent symptoms of allergic Rhinitis were sensitive to Parthenium pollen.</p>
<p> All those persons with a clinical history of Asthama or Rhinitis as well as some randomly selected normal subjects from the survey populations are being contacted for detailed examination by in vivo and in vitro allergy tests. Patients suffering from Parthenium Rhinitis will be put on specific immunotherapy and the progression of desensitization will be evaluated periodically by monitoring clinical improvement and by measuring the levels of Parthenium-specific IgE and IgG antibodies in their sera.</p>
      

<h2>5. Eco-Development of Selected Micro-Catchments in the Bedthi, Aghanashini River Basins of Uttara Kannada District</h2>
<p> The Planning Commission had drawn up certain special area programmes for development of ecologically sensitive areas of the country. The Department of Environment, Government of India was given the responsibility to initiate action research projects in those areas. The monitoring committee of this programme while reviewing projects carried out by various institutions, felt the need for an interdisciplinary action research programme focusing on a micro-watershed. Bidthi-Aghanashini river valleys in the Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka form one of the seven areas selected for this purpose. Observations of imbalances have been voiced from various quarters, which have often been a result of limited sectorial interventions. </p>
<p> Surveying and inventorying the status of sources including land, water, cultivated crops, orchards, livestock, natural plant and animal life as well a the human population. </p>
<p> The implementation and the subsequent monitoring being an ongoing process, activities shall continue on the field. However, for the purpose of the project, the plans for these micro catchments can be considered as an achievement. The implementation shall be coordinated at village level of the local task force and as such the result of such a systematic implementation can be observed only after a time lag.</p>
<p> The micro level surveys were conducted in the micro catchments of Madenally and tattikai. These surveys were similar to those carried out in the sirsi-Makki and Masur-Lukkeri micro catchments. The compilation of data and its analysis were done.</p>
<p> Workshops were orgainsed during the year with the objective of involving district level government officials and academic personnel like teachers etc. Significant among these are two workshops: (a) Workshop on forests and estuary management, held at the Zilla Parishat, Karwar, and (b) teachers training programme for monitoring the status of environment and natural resources, organised at Masur. This training programme was towards equipping the teachers for educating the highschool students to undertake relevant field studies and services. A manual titled &quot;Monitoring studies of environment&quot; was prepared to serve high school teachers as a pedagogic aid.</p>
<p> An environment mapping exercise was carried out in Masur-Lukkeri catchment. The map gives details of location and area specific presence of various biotic species and land u se patterns. The land has been divided into 7 categories and further sub-classified into 27 components, superimposed on 50m x 50 m grid. This map would serve as a bench mark for the status of environment as on date, thus helping in the monitoring of progress associated with changes due to government interruptions.</p>

<h2>6. Air Pollution and Incidence of Morbid Conditions in Bangalore City</h2>
<p> A pilot study conducted by the Department of Management studies of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore reviewed the levels of pollutants, measured during 1985-86, such as hydro-carbons, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen at certain critical points in the central area of Bangalore city and projected the trends into the future (1987-1991). Exposure levels determined by a consideration of vehicular type and emissions at physoiological breathing zones of commuters and pedestrians revealed that critical levels are exceeded at most of the key points in the city. The same trend would continue in future too, unless preventive measure are taken soon.</p>
<p> During the study to integrate these results with prevailing total air degradation and morbidity conditions in the city. Thus, a total picture regarding air pollution emission loads emerging out of other sources such as domestic and industrial sectors has to be taken into consideration for an assessment. The possible association of pollution levels with morbid state of health conditions has to be understood. Only then will it be possible to arrive at appropriate levels of pollutants permissible for Bangalore city.</p>
<p> Explanatory investigation was carried out in two stages. In stage 1, the air quality assessments were conducted and in stage 2, health impact of sample population due to exposure to pollutants in the risk prone areas was analyzed.</p>

<h2>7. Identification and Characterization of Solid Waste Dump Sites and its Impact Study on Water and Soil in the State of Karnataka</h2>
<p>Principal Investigator: Dr. S. G. Sreekanteswara Swamy, Fellow, KSCST</p>

<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p> Municipal Solid Waste management (MSW) includes scientific collection, storage, transportation, treatment and effective disposal of waste. Urban planners and managers face critical problems due to inefficient management of MSW. The problem of MSW has grown over the years and its impact due to unscientific management has lead to serious environmental hazards, causing deterioration in quality of life in the cities. In addition, this has affected the local and regional economy.</p>

<h3> Municipal Solid Waste Management - Karnataka </h3>
<p> In Karnataka, among three types of waste generated in recent past, the largest amount generated is municipal solid waste (21,43,280 metric tons), followed by hazardous waste (86,137 metric tons) and biomedical waste (27,095 metric tons). For example, Bangalore has grown, as the fifth largest metropolitan city in India, inhabited by over 5 million people generating over 3000 tons of MSW per day. Rapid urbanization has led to generation of large quantities of municipal solid waste. Municipals solid waste is being dumped on open sites outside the city limits since many years and only recently a few cities or towns in the state have engineered landfill. The waste generated is being disposed in open lands, into water bodies, into rivers or into any low-lying areas. In some cases the waste is being disposed into fresh water bodies leading to contamination or pollution of valuable water resources. Improper disposal of these wastes often results in contamination of soil and water bodies, which could further lead to spread of diseases. </p>
<p> In major cities like Bangalore, Belgaum, Gulbarga, Hubli-Dharwar, Mangalore and Mysore and other taluka places in the state, solid waste is being dumped on open sites outside municipal limits of cities and towns. Since implementation of MSW Rules, 2000, some of the Corporations and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) are identifying landfill sites to waste recycling system, in turn, to dispose the non-recyclable municipal wastes. Thus, most of the collected waste is disposed on private lands or municipal corporation land, situated in the outskirts of the city or town. During the field visit, the team visited many dumping sites and examined them. </p>
<p> Scientific waste disposal is a community activity, as the community is responsible for generation of waste and therefore, management of waste disposal should start at source itself (by community). Some of the ULBs have attempted to generate awareness among public to segregate waste. In major cities and towns, there are several residential welfare associations involved in household waste collection at doorsteps, both in city metropolitan area and in the city municipal area (i.e., ULBs) and door-to-door waste collection is done by civic authorities to be done successfully. Apart from residential welfare associations, the other stakeholders who play critical role in MSW management are rag pickers, NGOs and self-help groups who help in reusing or recycling the waste.</p>

<h3> Problems of municipal solid waste </h3>

<p> The key problems of municipal solid waste include:</p>
<ul>
	<li> Mixing of waste </li>
	<li> Collection and storage of waste </li>
	<li> Transportation of waste </li>
	<li> Indiscriminate burning of waste </li>
	<li> Illegal disposal of waste</li>
</ul>

<h3> Aims and Objectives </h3>
<ul>
	<li> To study the dumping yards system </li>
	<li> Study of impact of proximity of dumpsites on soil and water </li>
	<li> To develop a detailed database on scientifically generated data and technical aspects to treat and dispose the waste generated in the state. </li>
	<li> Critical study of current Solid Waste Management strategy, technology practices and characterization of solid waste. </li>
	<li> To develop a common platform for resource persons, resource institutions, local agencies, implementing agencies and the law enforcing authorities for dissemination of information and technical asset formation. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Methodology </h3> 
<p>The following methodologies were followed during the sample collection:</p>
<ul>
	<li> Identification of the site: Field visits were arranged to each taluka (175) of all the districts in the State to identify, quantify and assess the waste disposal sites. </li>
	<li> Description of the site: After identifying the waste disposal site, the site details, like waste quantity, quality, age of the dump site, waste spread area, location of the site with permanent features with reference to location, nearby water bodies (with surface &amp; ground water), important buildings or monuments, historical places etc were recorded. Also socio-economic details like agricultural activity, habitation and living standards of the people in the vicinity were recorded. </li>
	<li> Quantification: Waste spread area and height of the dumpsite were recorded. </li>
	<li> Assessment of the site: After having the details of the dumping site, waste quality and quantity and place of disposal were assessed, prioritized and ranked, based on population potential of the site and severity of impact on man and environment. Further, type of waste, land environment, air environment, water environment, health issues and public annoyance were recorded and each site was ranked through Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) (Table No.5 of each district report). </li>
	<li> Sampling: The data collection was undertaken in two stages. As first stage, the dumpsite details were collected form the Officers of the urban local bodies (ULBs) and the Directorate of Municipal Authority at State level. In second stage the soil and water samples were collected, based on the sensitivity of individual dumpsites of all the taluks in the State. A total of 400 water samples and 270 soil samples were collected during the visit. </li>
	<li> Water sampling: The water sources within 0.5 km radius of dump site were identified and samples were collected after extraction of water either from hand pump, tube well or surface sources. For this purpose, one liter capacity pre-cleaned Polyvenyl Chloride (PVC) cans was used. The bore well water was allowed to flow for 3 to 5 minutes before collecting samples into cans. The cans were suitably labeled with information on date of collection, time of collection, sample location. For heavy metal analysis 2 ml of nitric acid was added to the sampling cans as preservative and were transported to laboratory. </li>
	<li> Soil Sampling: Soil samples were collected near dumpsites, at depth of 15-50 cm. The soil samples were collected and stored in a thick polythene covers. The covers were suitably labeled with information on data of collection, time of collection and sample location. The samples were transferred to laboratory. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Details of Analysis </h3>
<p> For maintaining health of people, the quality of the drinking water is very important. The ground water quality depends on anthropogenic and geogenic activities. Owing to these factors, the ground water quality is not constant but can be varying. During the study the physical and chemical parameters were considered for water samples. Soil samples were also analyzed. </p> 
<p> The physical parameters include colour, odour, taste and turbidity. The ground water from bore well is generally colourless and odourless and of good taste. But effluents or presence of excess salts can impart a taste to water. </p>
<p> The chemical parameters are pH, Total Suspended Solids, Total Dissolved Solids, Electrical Conductivity, Dissolved Oxygen, Cations (Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Iron, and Magnesium) and Anions (Carbonate, Bicarbonate, Sulphate, Nitrate, Chloride, Phosphate, Silicate and Fluoride). The soil parameters considered are Calcium, Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium, Nitrate, Chloride, Specific Conductance and pH. </p>

<h3> Outcome of the project </h3>
<p> It is observed that there is enormous increase and abuse of Municipal Solid Wastes (MSW) in various parts of the State. Much of Municipal Solid Wastes generated in the small towns and peri urban areas are dumped haphazardly in open dumps that are often very close to human habitation as well. </p>
<p> A total of 14 parameters for water resources around dumpsite, and another 9 parameters were studied for soil around these dump site. The waste dumped at such sites includes domestic waste, example, kitchen waste, paper, glass and cloths. Construction and demolition waste consisting of sand, bricks, concrete blocks and rock cuttings are also dumped. Further, waste from the poultry, slaughterhouse, hospital and vegetable markets is also dumped. Most of the local bodies deposit waste at the dump-yard without ascertaining the suitability of the land for waste disposal. </p>
<p> In high rainfall belt of the Western Ghats and in rainfall rich coastal belts and surrounding taluks of Bangalore has very high content of decomposable organic matter. As decomposition rates of organic matter is high, a large quantity of nitrogen is released into soils around these dumpsites that has greatly enhanced the nitrate levels in both soils and ground water around these sites. </p>
<p> In the drier belt of northern Karnataka there is significant reduction in the organic matter content of the wastes found on the dump sites and maybe attributable to the consumption by small and medium sized domestic and non domestic animals. </p>
<p> Most of the ULBs are identified landfill sites in their locations and are justifying for the proper operation procedures namely need for a landfill, evaluation and community acceptance of the landfill location, landfill design and cost-effectiveness. Waste collection, transportation and disposal must now support source reduction and recycling activities. </p>
<p> A total of all the 175 taluks were assessed across a state spanning an area of 1,91,000 sq. km. We conclude that with a high premium on land available for carrying out dumping it is now important to move to decentralized bio energy/bio technological solutions such that more than 50% of the MSW (the decomposable fractions) could be treated locally. </p>
<p> The Investigator is highly thankful to the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, New Delhi for their support. </p>

<p>Karnataka is rapidly urbanizing and large number of small towns and villages have becoming urban centers. This rapid growth brings in its wake concomitant problems relate to urban infrastructure such as , energy, water supply, waste water treatment, solid waste, plastic waste and bio medical waste management etc. The magnitudes of these problems were poorly documented and almost the quantum of waste generated is determined by the thumb rules rather than by actual and detailed measurements. Further the collection mechanisms, the processing options, the disposal options are again pushed by guidelines rather than what is really suitable to the location as well as the city. The quantum of wastes generated is determined by the availability of year round vegetables and fruits, socio-economic status of the location as well as the affluence and cultural practices of the city during the recent past.</p>
<p>In this context there is a need for a status report that will reflect upon the potential of all these activities in meeting the spirit and goals of the Solid Waste management rules and guidelines. The detailed status report will be prepared as per stipulated norms and guidelines of KSPCB and CPCB.</p>

</ul>

<h3> Progress since November 2009: </h3>
<p> The helpdesk at the Council was established on 29th of October 2009 at Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology. The helpdesk was initiated through a popular programme at R.T. Nagar on 18th October 2009 by Sri Katta Subramanya Naidu, Hon’ble Minister, BWSSB. The helpdesk primarily aims at training the stake holders such as architects, engineers, contractors, plumbers, masons, etc within Bangalore city through several Training Programmes. Awareness Camps are arranged to bring in awareness among the general public regarding Rainwater Harvesting. Information on technical details of RWH and ground water recharge are being provided at RWH helpdesk for those who visit KSCST or contact through telephone, web and email. </p>
<p> There were 16 Training Programmes held at KSCST for the plumbers till March 2010 and around 485 plumbers and civil contractors registered under BWSSB have been trained. Hands on training along with the field visits were organized to provide practical exposure on the cost effective and sustainable RWH technologies. </p>
<p> There were 12 Awareness Camps held at different Assembly constituencies of Bangalore city (R.T. Nagar, Basavangudi, Rajajinagar, Malleshwaram, Vishweshwarapuram, Padmanabhnagar, Mahalakshmipuram, Coffee Board Layout at Hebbal, Shantinagar, Yelahanka New Town, BTM Layout and Basweshwarnagar) with the support of the local MLAs and leaders. Around 5000 people participated in these awareness programmes. </p>
<p> In addition to training and awareness programmes, 106 buildings of BWSSB (including service stations, sub division offices, ground level reservoirs and quarters) were visited to prepare Detailed Project Reports (DPR) for undertaking Rainwater Harvesting. The DPR has been submitted to BWSSB and is in the advanced stage of implementation. </p>
<p> RWH helpdesk at KSCST has emerged as one stop solution and an effort of the Council to conserve water in the city of Bangalore. Rainwater Harvesting is one of the prioritized projects of KSCST and an important measure to mitigate water scarcity and augment existing water supply. </p>

<p> Apart from collecting the large quantities (~20 tonnes) of tailings samples from the Kudremukh Iron Ore Company limited at Kudremukh, the following R&amp;D work is completed. </p>
<p> Characterization of the physical properties of the iron ore tailings </p>
<p> Flow characteristics of mortars using ore tailings </p>

<h3> Observations: </h3>
<ol>
	<li> Coarse sand fraction is totally absent in the iron ore tailing samples. Medium and fine sand present is more than the silt fraction in all the samples. A small amount of clay size fraction (1 - 4%) in tailing samples is present. The specific gravity of the tailing samples varies between 2.77 and 3.35. </li>
	<li> Flow versus water-binder (W/B) ratio is linear. Flow increases with increase in W/B ratio. Maximum flow value is achieved for 25% 
                  sand replacement by the tailings in all the 12 mix proportions attempted. </li>
	<li> The mortar shrinkage is minimum at 25% iron ore tailings for all three grades of mortars and is maximum for 100% tailings substitution. </li>
	<li> Iron ore tailings can be successfully used for mortars in masonry and renderings. </li>
	<li> Leachability, durability, shrinkage and long term strengths are being studied for making final recommendations. </li>

<h3> Background: </h3>
<p> Desiccated coconut industries of Karnataka are situated in Tiptur and Tumkur Taluks of Tumkur District. The desiccated coconut industries are water intensive as they use huge volume of water and simultaneously discharge them. Coconut water produced from the opening of the coconut is also discharged along with other waste water streams, altogether making huge volume of waste water discharge. The waste water discharged has extremely pungent and foul odor due to the presence of high organic content and rancid oil that is often intolerable Waste water emerging from (a) within a coconut, (b) coconut kernel washing and (c) virgin coconut oil extraction, form the key components. Preliminary studies are underway to establish the composition and variability in composition and physico-chemical behaviour of these different waste waters. These wastewaters have a mix of coconut solids and pith in fine particulates, fine emulsion of coconut oil and saccharidic material as dissolved solids. Attempts will be made to evolve simple methods to separate the solids and liquids as well as oil from this wastewaters so that appropriate treatment options can be devised. The project would work towards value addition to the waste and wastewater. </p>
<p> The Council has received the first installment of the funds during January 2012 and started the R &amp; D activities at CST, IISc, laboratory. </p>

<h3> Present scenario and need for the study </h3>
<p> Timber is a very important natural resource which supported local/ fregional building construction activities of man from early civilization. Growth and abundance of particular timber species is specifically connected to its geographical context, namely to its climatic and soil condition. A plant / timber species has an ecological niche and it is part of local biodiversity web. So its growth, utilization and decay within a geographical context play a critical role in maintaining a healthy environment. As a locally available material timber also influence the development of vernacular architectural form and character. It also has a strong contribution in nurturing local craft tradition. </p>
<p> Proposed study project would attempt to identify local demand of timber through estimating present pattern of consumption in local building sector. Project will also investigate the potential of local land and climate to regenerate local timber species. Assessment of performance of local timbers in traditional construction will be highlighted through a scientific documentation. </p>
