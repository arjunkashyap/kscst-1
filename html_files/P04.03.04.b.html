<h2>End User Interactions:</a></h2>
<p>In each district there are several line departments, which are responsible for implementing the various schemes and programmes of the State and Central Government. These departments come under the direct control of Zilla Panchayath and the Deputy Commissioner office. The planning is done at the Zilla Panchayath level and also in some cases Deputy Commissioners level. Lot of information is required in planning an activity. Hence the NRDMS district centers are assisting the planning and executing bodies in providing these information and also help them in preparing their plans using GIS based technology. In this connection several workshops and training programmes have organized by the NRDMS centers to create an awareness of GIS technologies. The Council conducted user level workshops in all the districts of the State in the year 2007 - 08 to create awareness among end users in the utilisation of geospatial technologies in planning.</p>
