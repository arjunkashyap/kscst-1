<h2> Illustrations for Rainwater Harvesting at Residential Buildings</h2>

<h3> Case - I:</h3>
<p> Keep a water storage tank or a structure below down water pipe, which carry rainwater from roof. Guide the overflow of the tank to the drain on the road side/recharge ground water. Use the collected water for gardening, vehicle washing etc. when required. This water cannot be stored for many days since organic matter coming from rainwater will start decaying in the storage tank and will contaminate water. </p>

<h3> Case - II:</h3>
<p> Rainwater flowing from the roof through down pipes has to be filtered for removing organic/inorganic substances. This filtered water may be allowed to flow directly to a storage device kept on the ground. The overflow of this tank may be connected to the drainage on the rode side/recharge ground water.<br> Steps involved: </p>
<p> a. Connection from down water pipe to rainwater filter</p>
<p> b. Installation of “PopUp Filter” to tank</p>
<p> c. Installation of storage tank</p>
<p> d. Piping connection from filter to the tank and</p>
<p> e. Overflow of the tank to outside drain/ground water recharge</p>
<p> Process: Flush the first rainwater by opening the flush cap on the filter for few minutes, close the flush cap after all the dirt on the roof is flushed out and clean water starts flowing. Remove the filter cartridge gently from its place and wash it thoroughly under a running tap by gently tapping the filter element with a stick on all sides. The dirt sticking in the filter element gets released and washes off. Replace clean filter element back to its place by gently inserting it in the vertical pipe. Take care not to press it too hard at the end. If pressed too hard, filter element may get locked inside the pipe and may require greater force to retrieve it back and also may not PopUp when the filter is clogged or choked. Allow the filtered water to get stored in tank for future use.</p>

<h3> Case - III:</h3>
<p> In a building having a roof at differential levels or where more than one floor building is involved, rainwater may be allowed to flow from the top most roof through down pipes to roof next below it. Here rainwater has to be guided to flow through the filter to remove organic/inorganic substances. This filtered water may be allowed to flow directly to a 
storage tank kept on the intermediate roof (may be ground floor roof). Overflow of this tank may be connected to an underground sump or to the drain on the roadside or to recharge ground water.</p>
<p> Steps involved</p>
<p> a. Connection from down water pipe to rainwater filter</p>
<p> b. Installation of &quot;PopUp Filter&quot;</p>
<p> c. Installation of storage tank on the ground floor roof/intermediate roof</p>
<p> d. Piping connection from filter to the tank</p>
<p> e. Connection of overflow from the tank to underground sump or to the out side drain or recharge ground water</p>
<p> Process: Flush the first rain water by opening the flush cap on the filter for few minutes, close the flush cap after all the dirt on the roof is flushed out and clean water starts flowing. Remove the filter cartridge gently from its place and wash it thoroughly under a running tap by gently tapping the filter element with a stick on all sides. The dirt sticking in the filter element gets released and washes off. Replace clean filter element back to its place by gently inserting it in the vertical pipe. Take care not to press it too hard at the end. If pressed too hard, filter element gets locked inside the pipe and may require greater force to retrieve it back when required for cleaning and also may not PopUp when the filter is clogged or chocked. Allow the filtered water to get stored in tank for future use. </p>
<p> Water stored in the tank can be used for gardening, vehicle washing, toilet flushing etc. Since water is stored on the rooftop, there is no need for a pump to pump-up water. Water can be allowed to flow by gravity. The overflow of this tank is connected to a secondary storage at underground sump. Water from the overhead tank can be used first and on using up all water in the overhead tank, water stored in the underground sump can be pumped up for use during subsequent non rainy days.</p>
