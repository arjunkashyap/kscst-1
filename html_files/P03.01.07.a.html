<h1>Health Projects</h1><h2> 1. Asthma Research</h2><p> Asthma is a complex-disease and there is no one cause for it. Several causes, both endogenous as well as exogenous, are known to contribute to its incidence. Instances have been cited where people, who have never exhibited tendencies earlier, have had attacks of Asthma on coming to Bangalore. Furthermore, those who have had only mild attacks elsewhere experience severe ones here. It has been recorded that on leaving Bangalore, the severity of these attacks is nitrated and people obtain relief. It would, therefore, appear that there are factors special to Bangalore which conduce the onset of Asthma.</p><p>Environmental studies conducted in several countries have indicated that pollen and fungal spores are implicated. With a view to examining the role of these, a systematic investigation of the pollen and fungal spore content of the atmosphere in Bangalore has been undertaken from July 1976. The investigation is being carried out by Asthma Research Society of Bangalore with support funding from KSCST.<p></p><h2>2. Energy Food / Care Food</h2><p> The Government of Karnataka has undertaken a number of programmes to combat malnutrition among the vulnerable sections of the populations. Significant among these is the mid-day meal programme for pre-school and school children assisted by CARE and administered by the Department of Public Instruction.</p><p> Since the state government had planned to progressively replace CARE assistance, a low-cost alternative to CARE food had to be developed. This was identified as one of the first projects by KSCST and a wheat-based formulation called Energy Food was developed by the Central Food Technological Research Institute, Measure. Based on the project report prepared by CFTRI, the state government is setting up 5 units for the manufacture Energy Food is different part of the State.</p><h2>3. Feasibility Study for a Medical Electronic Equipment Service Centre</h2><p> In an earlier survey project on medical equipments, it had been found that X-ray equipment was one of the most commonly used equipment in government institutions. The earlier study indicated that out of the 12 hospitals surveyed, 11 had x-ray equipment and in all accounted for 42.3% of the total medical electronic equipments. This project was launched to study the causes of equipment failure, the reasons for high down time and lacunae, if any, in the procedure being followed in repair and maintenance of equipment was selected on account of their widespread usage. It was felt that attempts should be made to simplify the present procedures for undertaking repairs, procuring consumables etc., such that the equipment could be used more effectively. </p><h2>4. Occurance of Paralytic Shellfish Poison (Saxitoxin) in Shellfishes of Karnataka </h2><p> Paralytic shellfish poisoning in man is caused by a potent toxin called saxitoxin, which is neuro-toxic and produced by marine toxic dinoflagellates. Various vehicles of paralytic shellfish poisoning are clams, mussels, oysters, scallops and molluscs which become toxic by feeding on toxic dinoflagellates. The shellfishes, which accumulate the poison, are themselves not affected by the lethal toxin.</p><p> Paralytic shellfish poisoning poses a serious problem by virtue of the strong toxicity of the poison (minimum lethal dose in mice is 10 micrograms/kg). Its occurrence is well known in countries like U.S.A., Canada, Japan and other European countries, but the outbreak at Kumble near Kasargod in 1983 happened to be the first case reported in India. During this outbreak, paralytic shellfish poisoning had resulted in death of a boy and hospitalisation of several others following consumption of toxic clams and oysters.</p><p> Mouse bioassay techniques of Sommer &amp; Meyer adopted by AOAC (Association of Official Analytical Chemists) has been method of choice for assay of poison levels. The permissible limit in edible shellfishes is 400 MU/100g. When the toxin levels exceed this limit, harvesting of shellfishes or sale should be prohibited from public health point of view. Incidentally, the toxin level detected in shellfishes at Kumble during the 1983 outbreak were of the order of 20,000 MU/100g which is a lethal dose for human beings. It was felt that if such a toxin occurs in shellfishes in other extuaries in Karnataka, it would pose a serious public health problem. </p>
