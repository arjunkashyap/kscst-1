<h1>KSCST : Natural Resources Data Management System</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Council initiated the Karnataka Natural Resources Data Management System (NRDMS) program in 1992 and since then established District NRDMS Centers in all the State with active support and funding from Department of Science &amp; Technology (DST) Government of India and Government of Karnataka. NRDMS program is a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional program of the Council aimed at developing methodologies for building and promoting the use of spatial data management and analysis technologies in local area planning. The initial approach of planning based on macro level assessment of resources did not yield the desired results. The introduction of the concept of spatial planning to micro-levels by the Planning commission paved the way for evolution of NRDMS program. The vision of the NRDMS program during its inception was to provide S&amp;T inputs for operationalising the concept of decentralized planning of the country by developing computer compatible spatial databases on natural resources, socio and agro-economic parameters to further the concept of area specific decentralized planning.</p>
<p>Resource knowledge and resource inventory is crucial to spatial planning. At the core of this concept lies an integrated approach to planning in contrast to the sectoral method. This requires a detailed knowledge of the interrelations and interdependencies between various sectors to resolve often-conflicting demands. This leads to a requirement for appropriate data management and analyzing tools and techniques and a large matrix of sectoral data, in digital format, on natural resources, demography, socio-economy etc. and integrating them to generate appropriate information/applications required for plan preparation.</p>
<p>The district NRDMS centers since inception have created an exhaustive database of natural resources, socio-economic parameters, infrastructure etc. The NRDMS centres are providing analyzed/value added information to planners and administrators besides developing applications using geo-spatial technologies suitable for local level planning. The NRDMS centers are providing need-based information to users such as elected bodies, district administration and planners through maps, charts, tables, and reports etc., on spatial and non-spatial data.</p>
