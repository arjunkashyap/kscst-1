<h1> Scientists Students Interaction Programme (SSIP)</h1>
<h2>Background<h2>
<p>In order to improve the quality of education in the State especially in rural areas, it is felt necessary to introduce some effective programme in schools and colleges. This would help in creating awareness in the students and improve their career to undertake science as profession. Some of the programmes have been already under implementation by Government of Karnataka. Inspired by the successful programmes like "Mahithi Sindhu" and the extension lecture programme of Indian Institute of Science, Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology has taken a decision to conduct programmes of interaction of students with scientists in the schools and colleges throughout the state. This programme is called the Scientists Students interaction Programme (SSIP).</p>
<p>This programme was experimented on one occasion and it was successful. The students were excited to be with the scientists and participated actively by posing a large number of questions. It is felt that this is one of the way of popularising science and technology in many schools in the State as well as ignite the curiosity of Students. This will also motivate the students to go in for basic science education. </p>
