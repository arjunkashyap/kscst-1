<h1>Energy Projects</h1><h2>16. Solar Powered 10 Tonne Cold Storage Project at Mangalore</h2><p> Considering the need for a cold chain in the northern part of Karnataka, a joint project with KFDC on solar powered cold storage unit was initiated. Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation is providing the infrastructural facilities. The project is being funded by the Department of Non conventional Energy sources, New Delhi and KFDC. The northern part of Karnataka receives maximum insolation as compared to the other parts of Karnataka and the availability of electricity is not ensured throughout the day.</p><p> There are two possible ways of utilising solar energy to operate cold storage units viz., vapour absorption refrigeration system (VAR) and vapour compression refrigeration system (VCR). The coefficient of performance of VCR is 2.5 to 3.0 while for VAR it is 0.2 to 0.3. In view of this a vapour compression refrigeration system is proposed for the cold storage unit. The solar photovoltaic module will be used to convert the solar energy to electrical energy which will then be used to derive the mechanical energy needed to run the compressor through a battery bank.</p><h2>17. Demonstration of 100 kW Gasifier at Navodaya Vidyalaya</h2>    <p> The team has designed, fabricated and tested successfully a woodgasifier and has reported a peak performance of 93% diesel replacement in diesel engines, with the average being around 80%. This gasifier uses wood chips to generate the wood gas.</p><p> During the dissemination programme, feed back was regularly collected which showed that while there are shortages of hard woody biomass, various other forms of biomass are available in rural areas. They are dried leaves, twigs, saw dust, coir pith, rice husk etc. Therefore it would be ideal to develop gasifiers which can make use of such biomass. There were two choices namely, briquetting these biomass and using them in the existing gasifier or develop a gasifier to use pulverised biomass. But considering the fact that the generation of uniform density briquettes, it is necessary to powder the biomass first, it was felt that an ideal strategy would be to develop gasifiers that can make use of powdery biomass. Hence the project was initiated with the objective of designing and developing gasifiers for powdery biomass.</p><p>For further information on biomass gasification please visit the website:<a target="_blank" href="http://cgpl.iisc.ernet.in/BiomassGasification.html"> http://cgpl.iisc.ernet.in/BiomassGasification.html</a></p><h2>18. Rural Energy Centres</h2><p> In our efforts to disseminate appropriate energy technologies based on local energy sources, a project to set up a community bio-gas plant was initiated in Pura village, Kunigal taluk. Tumkur district in October 1979.<br> Under this project a rural energy center was set up at Pura with the following features :</p><ol>	<li> The energy center has two biogas plants of 750 cft/day capacity.</li>	<li> The gas generated is used to run a dual fuel engine-genset of 7 HP .5 kVA rating running on diesel and biogas. About 75% of the diesel is replaced by biogas in this mode of operation.</li>	<li> The electricity thus generated is used to pump water to the village drinking water supply system and to provide electrical illumination for the houses.</li>	<li> The water supply system consists of a 3-phase, 3 HP, 1500 gallons/hr submersible pump, 1 2500 litres overhead tank and 9 taps located at convenient sites in the village, one of them being for livestock.</li>	<li> The lighting system consists of 97 fluorescent lamps of 20W each of illuminate the households and one fluorescent lamp of 40 W for the biogas plant area.</li></ol><h2>19. Solar Energy in Sericulture</h2><p> The sericulture industry is an extremely labour intensive cottage industry employing about two million people in the private sector and twelve thousand five hundred people in the public sector in Karnataka. The Government of Karnataka operates seven filatures (wherein cocoons are reeled for obtaining silk yarn) besides silk mills and several rearing farms (where silk worms are reared). The area under mulberry cultivation is growing rapidly and is now more than 265 lakh acres in Karnataka. Of these, 98% of mulberry gardens are in the districts of Mysore, Mandya, Tumkur, Bangalore and Kolar.</p><p> The government silk filatures and silk factories derive their stream and hot water from coal-fired boilers of antiquated design. Although the component of the energy cost in the total cost of silk produced in such filatures is rather modest, the substitution of the present fossil energy resource(coat) by solar energy has several decided advantages like :</p><ol>          	<li> demonstration of the feasibility of using solar energy for most sericulture operations.</li>       	<li> reducing the dependence of the filatures on fossil fuels whose cost is continually increasing and whose availability is rather irregular and scarce</li>	<li> further reduction in the cost of energy components.</li></ol><p> It is in this context that KSCST has initiated a project with the objectives of investigating the scope with the objectives of Investigating the scope of solar energy applications in sericulture and demonstrating them on apilot basis. Specifically, use of solar energy for<br/> (1) supplying hot water for reeling and<br/> (2) cooling and/or heating of buildings for rearing silk worms and for storing cocoons are being explored.</p><h2>20. NPIC-Technical Backup Unit</h2><p> Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology had initiated several projects in the development of fuel efficient wood burning stoves for domestic as well as commercial applications. The success of these projects prompted the Department of Non-Conventional Energy Sources, Government of India, to request KSCST to set up a Technical Back Up Unit to provide technical support to their National Programme on improved Chulhas, in Karnataka. Since its inception the TBU has been active in the development of various designs of fuel efficient woodstoves for domestic as well as non-domestic uses.</p><p> The technical Back Up Unit carried out the following activities.</p><ol><li> Research and Development: 	<ol>		<li> Development of pottery liners of Astra Stoves</li>		<li> Standardization of design for a 2-pan Astra Stove</li>	</ol></li><li> Development and testing of portable metallic stove (SWOSTHEE)</li><li> Development of pottery/ceramic based portable stoves</li><li> Field trials</li><li> Training programmes</li></ol><h2>21. Inventory of Existing Technologies on Biomass Gasification</h2><p> The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India, New Delhi has initiated a project &quot;Inventory of Existing Technologies&quot; to collect the information of various rural oriented technologies carried out in the country and to prepare a database of these technologies. They propose to host this information in their website for free public dissemination. In this regard, DSIR has approached Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology (KSCST) to make an inventory of technologies in the field of Biomass gasification.</p><p> KSCST Technical team had visited several biomass gasification plants, which are engaged in the field of R&amp;D and manufacturing of biomass gasification plants and collected the following technical information from the industry</p><ol>	<li> Technological details</li>	<li> Name and address of the scientists involved</li>	<li> Number of operational installations and their location</li>	<li> Power rating of the installation</li>	<li> Case studies &amp; User feed back</li>	<li> Raw material / fuel used in these installations</li>	<li> Purpose - Heating or electricity</li>	<li> Operational data if any</li>	<li> Type of user Demonstration / Community benefit / Commercial use</li></ol><p> Final report was prepared and submitted to DSIR to host in their website.</p><p><a href="../external_links/Biomass_Gasification_Inventory_Report_KSCST.pdf"> Click on this link to view / download the report in .pdf format.</a></p><h2> 22.
