<h1>Agriculture Projects</h1><h2>1. Sandalwood Spike Disease</h2><p> Sandal, the pride of Karnataka's forest wealth, is a perennial plant and exploitation of the plant for wood and oil is of great commercxial importance. The specie is a native of the southern part of India and nearly 80% of sandal oil production in India is in Karnataka.</p><p> However, sandal trees are susceptible to a serious disease, known as the spike disease, which was first observed in 1888. The disease causes an extreme smalling of leaves with sprouting of auxiliary buds, resulting in the certain death of infected trees. Although considerable research has been done, practical control measures are not available. The casual agent and mode of transmission of the disease are not established although some research shows that the causal agent might be a mycoplasma, and certain inspect species have been incriminated as vectors of the disease.</p><p> The major lines along which the research was carried out are indicated below:</p><ol>	<li> A survey of sandal forests in Karnataka to estimate the extent and distribution of the disease. </li>	<li> Techniques for experimental transmission of the disease so that large number of seedlings/clones could be tested for reaction to the disease in the shortest possible period. </li>	<li> Vegetative propagation of sandal to achieve high levels of rooting and establishment; suited of most suitable host plants for sandal; mineral nutrition of sandal using tracer techniques. </li>	<li> Ecological studies on the possible vectors and manipulation of the forest environment to minimise their multiplication and movement. </li></ol><h2>2. Development, Demonstration &amp; Diffusion of Prawn Culture Technology</h2><p> Fishing is one of the major economic activities in the coastal district of Uttara Kannada. Amongst all the fishing activities, prawn fishing takes the pride of place as it has a lucrative export market. Consequently prawn fishing in open sea waters has developed over the years to such an extent that problems of overfishing have now begun to crop up. On the contrary, prawn culture in brackishwater areas of the district is hardly practised. The reasons for under utilization of the brackishwater areas are (a) inadequate development of intensive culture technology and poor adaptation to the local conditions of the district, (b) Non-availability in large numbers of commercially important prawn seedling and (c) the socio-economic conditions of the farmers and sheer ignorance of available intensive culture technology. The land holding in the brackishwater area is small and fragmented whereas, traditional culture practices require large water areas. The solution therefore lies in the large scale production of prawn seeds under controlled conditions and rearing of desired species. Though the basic know how for intensive prawn culture is available, no attempt has been made to evolve a locale specific optimal technology package that can easily be used by farmers. </p><h2>3. Agroclimatology of Karnataka</h2><p> It is well recognised that for an agro-based economy like ours, the study of meterology is crucial. The predictions that an agriculturist requires pertain to soil-moisture variation in certain crucial stages of crop growth. While the meterologist measures regularly only one factor contributing to soil moisture , namely rainfall. Thus, the problem is truly complex, and a major lacuna is the development of a odel of the variation of the vertical profile of soil moisture as a response to variations of rainfall under varying conditions of climate, soil and plant cover.</p><p> Information currently available on the average distribution of rainfall for the year as a whole and for the various seasons, as well as charts showing variability of rainfall, do not lend themselves to direct utilisation in agricultural planning. Nor can such information be directly utilised for decision making in agricultural operations. The primary step for effective agricultural planning, therefore, would be determine the duration of the farming season at an operational level.</p><p> KSCST identified a project on the Agroclimatology of Karnataka with the objective of processing available rainfall data for the state in order to generate information which could be directlyused for planning of agricultural operations.</p><p> Eight Districts were studied. These districts fall in the semi aid tracts of Karnataka and comprise of Tumkur, Kolar, Chitradurga, Dharwar, Bangalore, Bidar, Bijapur and Gulbarga. The basic input for the analysis was a daily rainfall data for the period 1921-1970. On the basis of this analysis, recommendations have been arrive at for each district and these pertain to the choice of crop varieties which would lead to an optimal utilisation of available rain water.</p><h2>3a. Utilization of Cassia Tora as Fodder &amp; Feed: Ingredient for cultivable carps</h2><p> Artificial feeding is one of the important requirements for increasing fish production in composite fish culture. Several ingredients, both of plant and animal origin, are being used in preparing artificial feeds for carps. For rich production to be profitable, cheap and nutritious. From this point of view, Cassia tora looks promising as a suitable fodder or as a feed ingredient for carps. Cassia tora is a legumninous weed, growing luxuriously in several parts of India, during the period of May to October The leaves are at present not being put to any major use. Even cattle do not forage on this plant. Interestingly, fishermen in inland areas have observed certain carps feeding on Cassi a tora growing within low lying areas. Thus, there appears to be good scope for utilising the weed, as fodder, and also as a suitable feed ingredient in the diet of carps. This weed could become a reliable cheap supply of nutritious fodder for the phytophagus grass crap, Ctenopharyngodonidella which is a fast growing exotic carp.</p><p> The leaves of Cassia tora on analysis was found to contain 25 to 30% crude protein and 7-10% of fat, on dry weight basis. The percentage edible part of the plant varies from 30 to 40. Acceptability tests were conducted, where a set of grass carp yearling were provided with fresh Cassia tora in bundles. It was observed that grass carp consumed the weed readily and fully, leaving only the mid-rib part of the leaves.</p><h2>4. Immunization of Cultivable Fishes against Aeromonas Hydrophila Infection</h2><p> Aeromonas hydrophila is one of the commonest causes of disease in cultivable fishes in India. Instances of entire population of major carps getting wiped out by epidemics of A hydrophila infection in many stocking ponds have been reported. Immunization as a preventive measure in fish culture is gaining popularity. The success of a vaccine depends on its antigenic composition and the protective nature of antibodies induced. Hemolysin has been suspected to be an important virulence factor in A. hydrophila. Therefore with the objective of evaluating hemolysin negative derivative strain as a candidate strain for developing a vaccine for A.hydrophila infection.<p><h2>5. Plant Irrigation using Porous FRP Tubes Feasibility Study</h2><p> Agriculture still continues to be the most important means of livelihood for a large number of rural Indians. Therefore tackling the problems posed by drought becomes one of the most crucial tasks for the Government. It is also commonly believed that it is possible to conserve irrigation water through managing the discharge efficiently. Drip irrigation provides an efficient alternative but is rather expensive. With this as the back drop, juxtaposing with scenarios of recent development of new materials at premier institutes like NAL, the Council undertook a project with the primary objective of exploring the possibility of plant irrigation using FRP tubes. Drip irrigation is a very well known method of ensuring the right amount of water in the locality of the plant growth. But the nozzles used at the delivery end suffer from the defects arising out of flow blockages due to impure water (suspended particles) or due to natural corrosion of the metal. Leakages at the junction between the nozzles and the delivery tube have also been observed. Scientists working in the area of materials - plastics - feel that porousFRP tubes can be developed with the right degree of porosity to ensure the correct amount of discharge of water in the locality of the plant growth.</p><h2>6. Establishing Vegetation in Highly Eroded Lands under Dryland Conditions</h2><p> KSCST had organised a workshop to evolve a science and technology programme against drought and for development of dry lands in Karnataka, in 1987. At the end of this workshop a science and technology programme was drawn up, identifying specific areas requiring research and development efforts on a priority basis. This project deals with one such area related to the productive use of semi-arid wastelands.</p><p> Three fourths of the arable and non-arable land area in Karnataka fall in the category about 2 million ha. of land has been classified as barren and uncultivable forming nearly 10% of the area in all districts. Further 2 million ha of land treated as permanent pastures and miscellaneous groves are under-utilised. Latest reports indicate that the plant density is far from satisfactory even in forest lands (about 3 million ha). The demand for biomass based fuel, fodder and timber is constantly on the increase but the rate, extent and success of planting are not keeping pace with it. Since conventional afforestation techniques are not adequate to meet this situation, there is a need to develop a complete package of technology, including selection of suitable species and methods of planting to upgrade biomass productivity of wastelands and to control errosion. Hence the project on 'Establishing Vegetation in highly eroded lands under dry land conditions' was initiated.</p><h3> Dry land Agriculture</h3><p> Highly eroded wastelands in the watershed were surveyed for native flora. In all about 50 species were identified and the specimens are preserved in a herbarioum at the Operational Research Project office.</p><p> To identify land treatment suitable for different species, seven silva species were subjected to seven different types of land treatment. the species Graveliz robusta, Eucalyptus hybrid, Casurina equistifolia, Silanthus mulberica, Inga delcia, Acacia auriculiformis and Dalbergia sisso were planted in main plots.</p><h2>7. Green Manure for Paddy Crops of Karnataka: Investigation of Effectiveness of Stem Nodule Legume Sesbania Rostrata</h2><p> Paddy is grown in over 1 million hectares in Karnataka. This crop needs a nitrogen dose of 100-120 kg/ha. Many marginal and small farmers cannot afford to supply this through chemical fertilizers.</p><p> Green manuring is effective in meeting this demand and is also environmentally sustainable. Leguminous crops can be used as green manures, capable of fixing the atmospheric nitrogen to the average extent of 100 kgN/ha. Sesbania rostrata, a stem nodulating legume in symbiotic association with nodule bacteria is reported to have fixed upto 267 kgN/ha in a 52 day crop. It holds a lot of promist for nitrogen fixation under water-logged conditions rendering it ideal for rice fields. With the small and marginal farmer in mind, this project was initiated for steadying the rhizobial ecology of Sesbania rostrate, quantifying nitrogen fixation and testing it under field conditions. Dr. K. Shivappa Shetty of the University of Agricultural Sciences is the convener.</p><p> Initially nodulation induced by inoculating different species of Sesbania and Siratro with bacterial isolates from set and root nodules of sesbania was compared and found to nodulate sesbania rostrata and S. aculeata. A test for utilization of carbon sources showed that sodium succinate, sodium lactate, manitol and sucrose supported maximum azorhizobial growth. Plant growth, nodulation and quantity when observed indicated that S. rostrata showed higher nitrogen yield but lower fresh weight than S. aculeata. It responded to plant harmones by increasing dry matter as well as nitrogen yield.</p><p> Field studies on the influence of mineral nitrogen revealed that incorporation of 8.76 t/ha green biomass (with 25 percent of nitrogen fertilization recommended ) could produce the maximum yield of paddy grains as well as straw. In the field S. rostrata was found superior to other conventional green manuring legumes (viz, Dhaianch, Sunhemp, blackgram etc. ) in nitrogen accumulation. It also significantly increased the grain and straw yield. A green house experiment indicated that growing S. rostrata along with Azolla is highly beneficial.</p><h2>8. Genetic Improvement &amp; Rapid Vegetative Propagation in Tamarind &amp; Pomegranate through Tissue Culture</h2><p> Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology, has been emphasising the need for developing new approaches for combating drought. Mass propagation and planting of elite selections of fruit bearing trees in drought prone areas is believed toalleviate the problems of dryzones. A rich green coverage is expected to enhance the number of rainy days, improve the atmospheric humidity, reduce dessication and prevent soil erosion. The choice of fruit trees over other trees for large scale planting has the distinct advantage of serving dual purpose of providing green coverage as well as substantially supplementing the income of the people.</p><p> In this context, development of appropriate techniques for rapid and mass clonal propagation of Tamarind and Pomegranate acquires significance. Tamarind is a highly drought tolerant fruit tree grown in waste lands in semi-arid tropics. Elite selections yield as much as 200 kg per tree as against 30 to 40 kg of common types. Tamarind has many uses in addition to fruit pulp; the young leaves and flowers are edible, the heart-wood is very hard and termite resistant.</p><p> Pomegranate is another potential fruit plant, grown for edible fruits. The other plant parts are known to be used for medicinal purposes. The wide variation of potential yield is attricuted to cross pollination. In both the cases the conventional methods of propagation are inefficient in terms of times and labour. The tree plants would lead to variation in progenies as most of them are highly heterozygous due to open pollination. In vitro propagation techniques appear to provide the best alternative to conventional methods.</p><h2>9. Influence of Vermicompost Application on Growth and Yield of Cereals &amp; Ornamental Plants</h2><p> Earthworms form the major soil macrofauna in temperate and tropical soils. Several species of earthworms are distributed in the soils of Karnataka. A few of these species can produce large quantities of excrements. Such species can be cultured and cultivated to produce worm compost, an organic manure and worm biomass, a proteing. On providing sufficient organic wastes as feed every day the cultured worms can convert live times their body weight of organic matter into fine granular organic manure. This is known as vermicompost.</p><p> A technology has been developed to produce vermicompost. However, its fertilizer quality has not been established. Depending on this, vermicompost may be found to be useful as a supplement or a replacement for farmyard manure and chemical fertilizers. With this background, this project was initiated with Dr. Radha D. Kale of University of Agricultural Sciences as the convener.</p><p> The objective of the project was to evaluate the vermicompost for its fertilizer quality against farmyard manure and chemical fertilizers by conducting histochemical and cytochemical studies of selected plants at their different growth stages.</p><h2>10.
