<h2>Genesis of NRDMS</h2>
<p>The balanced regional development and effective implementation of the basic needs of our society depends on the planning process which was initially the sectoral approach confined to the central level. This accentuated the inter and intra-regional disparities in the development and hence there was necessity to decentralize the planning process to smaller area units. During the VIII five-year plan a special emphasis was rightly given to the concept of decentralized planning. While adopting the seventy third and seventy fourth constitutional amendment acts (1992), a set of specific items covering various sectors viz., land, water, agro-economy etc., were identified. Concerned agencies were required to prepare and implement integrated development schemes. This growing urge for decentralizing the process and practice of planning prompted to take a fresh look at methods of data management.</p>
<p>In line with the above policy, the Natural Resources Data Management System NRDMS) project was launched by the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.</p>
<p>The basic imperative behind evolving NRDMS are:</p>
<ol>
	<li> Large diversity of spatial data.</li>
	<li> Many types of data are used for more than one purpose by more than one user.</li>
	<li> Utility of data set may be greatly enhanced by merging or linking it with other data sets.</li>
	<li> Reliability / consistency can be enhanced by correlating different parameters.</li>
	<li> Many organisations are involved in data collection and updating.</li>
	<li> Need for standardisation / compatibility of procedures of data collection and adoption.</li>
	<li> Need to improve the utilisation of data for decision making.</li>
</ol>
<p>The overall objective of the NRDMS is to increase the efficiency of utilization of resources through the application of scientific management principles and Geographical Information System [GIS] technology.</p>
